Maybe you could have your cats be visited by a bobcat who wants to claim the territory, but refuses to be polite or at least civil about it, and have your cats figure out how to get the bobcat out of their territory, or maybe have them befriend the bobcat, or even have them fight the bobcat away with a warning not to come back, or they&#039;ll attack relentlessly.]]></description>
