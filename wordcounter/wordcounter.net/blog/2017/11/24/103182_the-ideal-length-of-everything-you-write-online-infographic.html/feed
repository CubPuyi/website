Twitter says 100 characters vs paragraphs say 40-45 words. If each word were 5 characters long that would mean 200-225 characters per paragraph.

That&#039;s more than double the advised character count for paragraphs over tweets.

Also, I understand that your comment is old and you probably figured this out already. I figured other people who read your comment would appreciate the clarification.]]></description>

Twitter is 140 characters. If you use 5 letter words then you would have approximately 28 words. If you read closely you would know that it says 40-45 words for paragraphs. Paragraphs are supposed to be 4-5 sentences. That would be about 8 words in a sentence.]]></description>
