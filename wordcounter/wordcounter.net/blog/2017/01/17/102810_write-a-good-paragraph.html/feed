					<description><![CDATA[Yes, &quot;I have been told that being a dyslectic, would keep me from righting a book. But that never stopped me from doing it.&quot;

She replied know they suck you in and you forget the rest of the world and the next thing you know it&#039;s dark out side. So I said, &quot;I thought that&#039;s what books were suppose to be like. Then I told her there was three more books wrote already.&quot; 
PS.  And she reading book three for the fourth time.]]></description>
