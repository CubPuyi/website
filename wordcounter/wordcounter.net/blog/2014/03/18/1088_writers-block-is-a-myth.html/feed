					<description><![CDATA[Very loosely written article, though some of the comments are written well. I disagree , writers block does exist. One of the comment says, that it need not be in medical profession as its not creative, I strongly disagree. On the contrary even doctors and surgeons or even mechanic can have block, so is with  any other creative field and field that is evolving and changing. Surgeon can have a block not necessarily in a particular case, but occasionally one can loose faith in their abilities,that is a block! So everyone once in a while may have a block in the thought process. Comprehending writers block in just one dimension or linear fashion may lead to such blogs.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Whether or not it exists, my opinion is, &quot;Always have more than one writing project at any given time. That way if you get hung-up on something start work on other projects so you never stop being productive. If you need a break, try to read a good (or horrible) book, but do try to avoid TV.&quot;

I&#039;m a bit of a hypocrite about the TV thing, but typically I have about ten projects going all the time (not a good idea for people who don&#039;t keep good notes).

Thank you for the article :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Writer&#039;s block is the stopping of creative thinking in a certain direction because of indecision.
The inability to figure out how to proceed with a &quot;Single project.&quot; Just because one has writers block doesn&#039;t mean they couldn&#039;t write something different or some crappy one shot, their hands aren&#039;t gone. That seems to be a misconception on your part, of what writers block really is.

Personally? I don&#039;t have writer&#039;s block, I&#039;m just REAAAALY lazy, along with being busy. Bad mixture. Regardless, as a critic I do know it exists, I&#039;ve seen it. I&#039;ve been there helping hundreds of writers figure out what to do next.

It&#039;s not a disease or some excuse as you put it, it&#039;s a problem that needs work to get through. It can effect anyone working on anything creative. People can be burnt out and a new perspective is great. Honestly I suggest that anyone suffering from writers block simply talk to a close friend about the idea and ask for advice on how to move forward. Maybe brain storm.

Unwillingness to continue and being stumped are different things, something your article try&#039;s to deny. 

What you&#039;re approaching here isn&#039;t the absence of writer&#039;s block in existence, but people who use it as an excuse to be unwilling.

You&#039;re beef is with laziness, simple as that.  You may be clear headed all the time but most people aren&#039;t, most people simply don&#039;t have the imagination to match up with that.

I do agree with a few things in your article though. For instance, a doctor doesn&#039;t quit saving people because he&#039;s stumped. He finds something to study on the problem or procedure so he knows how to act accordingly, maybe he asks a friend.

It&#039;s the same with writing.

My personal cure for &quot;writers block&quot;?

Create an &quot;idea folder&quot; and get some themed music. Play the music, sit back and let your imagination run with it. Write down whatever you imagine, no matter how weird.

Eventually you&#039;ll have a folder filled to the brim with ideas to call upon and mold to your purpose when you find yourself confused or indecisive.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think this article rests on a general misunderstanding of what people think writers block is. When people say they have writers block, I don&#039;t think they think they have absolutely nothing to write. They just don&#039;t know how to advance a story or article in the direction they want because they don&#039;t know what direction they want to go down. 

I agree that some times it&#039;s just an excuse to do no writing at all  but creativity isn&#039;t always at a high. The same way a mathematician might not be able to solve a problem but come back later and find a different approach to it. 

I don&#039;t think writer&#039;s block is a myth but it can be intertwinned with the fear of not producing your best every time to you do something. 

Creativity can be improved just like any other skill in my opinion and you&#039;ll have stumbling blocks but it helps to just keep trying. 

Anyway, interesting article. Enjoyed reading it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I strongly disagree with your assertion and I feel I have a personal experience of what is commonly called &quot;writers block&quot;. I believe &quot;writers block&quot; is poorly named because surely those suffering it can surely write a shopping list or their name. In my case it was more a manifestation of the fear of inadequacy .Let me explain. I am a very creative person and in my teens wrote considerably. My &quot;block&quot; began when a creative writing teacher and a mythology teacher in my HIgh school both told my parents at a teachers conference that I was writing at a professional level and could make my living at it in spite of my relatively young age. When my parents,who were used to negative parent/teacher conferences, proudly informed me (not only was I a &quot;reformed&quot; dyslexic, lucky enough to have gotten fantastic therapy, I was , by that time a bit of a ne&#039;er do well and quite taken with the &quot;burn out&quot; culture that was popular at the time), nothing I wrote seemed good enough. I thought that I needed to create award winning, socially significant oeuvres that would change the world.Any socially or personal writing that I attempted seemed too personally revealing and my fiction seemed banal. I am now 51 and am looking to re-kindle the creativity that has always been there, but I just have to accept that writing is better than not writing. Though I have definite ideas of what the world needs to hear, I am still too worried what others might think of me. I&#039;ve often heard people make judgments on the imagination of others that I worry if I share some of my stranger thoughts that people I love and respect would think my characters or projections were an extension of my desires and an indication of a maladjustment. So I do believe in the idea of writers block, just not the term.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As a professional writer, I have to agree and disagree with this article.

First of all, writer&#039;s block is not a myth. There &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; times when you&#039;re simply stumped on where to go or how to describe something, and the best course of action may be to put your project down, do something else for a while, and let the answer come to you in its own time. It can happen to anyone, and it&#039;s not always your fault.

Drafting a detailed, complete outline before actually writing your book can reduce that problem, and remaining dedicated is certainly important, but even that I find sometimes won&#039;t totally eliminate the problem. Any detailed creative work has the potential to hit a snag, because no one can produce a constant stream of creativity, and solving abstract problems often just takes time. That&#039;s why painters and sculptors, as you mentioned, have their won equivalent of writer&#039;s block.

The examples you referred to of professions that &lt;i&gt;don&#039;t&lt;/i&gt; get an equivalent of writer&#039;s block are inapplicable, in my opinion. Surgery and auto repair are technical fields, not creative fields, and solutions lie in already knowing how to fix any problems that present themselves, a luxury that writers and artists don&#039;t have. However, even doctors and mechanics need to figure things out, and they can easily be baffled for a time by unique difficulties.

Runners perform with their bodies, not their minds, so they really &lt;i&gt;can&#039;t&lt;/i&gt; get an equivalent of writer&#039;s block. They can have a performance off-day if their body is ailed or something, but that&#039;s different. Athletes in competitive team sports can have days when their head isn&#039;t in the game, and that can be construed as a form of writer&#039;s block.

However, you&#039;re absolutely correct in saying that writer&#039;s block can be (and often is) artificially induced. I&#039;ve caught myself falling under several of the self-afflictions you listed, and I&#039;ve seen it happen to other writers I know. I&#039;ve had many days where there are about a dozen other things I&#039;d rather do, eliminating my focus and rendering me unable to continue my project. Other days, as you noted, I feel just plain lazy, and it&#039;s very difficult to progress with a disengaged mind.

Anyway, there&#039;s my two or three cents. A good and useful article overall, but I wouldn&#039;t be so quick to dismiss writer&#039;s block or to blame yourself for drawing a blank. My advice would be to ensure that you&#039;re not creating the block, and if you&#039;re not, just put down the project and let your mind rest. The answers will always come to the good writers, but sometimes it just takes time.]]></description>
