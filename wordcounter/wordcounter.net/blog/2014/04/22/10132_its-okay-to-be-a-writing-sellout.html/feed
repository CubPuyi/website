					<description><![CDATA[I know this is an old article, but I would like to throw in my 2 cents.

I&#039;m still in school, so I haven&#039;t yet had any experiences where I&#039;ve had to pay bills and taxes. However, I write during almost all my free time and someday I hope to make a living out of it. I completely agree with this article. I think if using what you&#039;re best at (even if it&#039;s for something unimportant like the writing on the back of a cereal box) to pay the bills is being a sellout, then a sellout is not necessarily a bad thing to be. It&#039;s simply having goals, but knowing reality. 

I also love acting, so I made up an analogy for this that pertains to acting:
If you want to get on Broadway but you don&#039;t have any theatre credits, you don&#039;t go straight to a cattle call for a Broadway show. You start small, in your local area, doing regional and community work. You take classes and you go to every audition you can find. You work your way up, maybe doing commercials or jobs outside your local area. And then, you can go to a Broadway audition prepared and comfortable in yourself as an actor. 

Equating a job on Broadway to a published novel, the small local jobs are the &quot;sellout jobs&quot;. But they&#039;re not really selling out, because local theatres are wonderful places. So maybe it&#039;s not a perfect analogy, but it works.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think being a sellout is a good thing. But also, I don&#039;t think you&#039;re a sellout for having a job and doing other things besides pursuing your dreams 24/7. I consider sellouts to be people who have lost all their principles, including their moral ones, for money. So when I read the title I instantly disagreed.

I don&#039;t think it&#039;s Okay to be an &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;-sellout. But I also don&#039;t think your friend&#039;s definition of a sellout (and yours apparently) is right. You shouldn&#039;t say you&#039;re a sellout only because you use your artistic skills to make money and pay your bills.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey,

I&#039;ve read a couple of articles on the &quot;Word Counter Blog,&quot; and have yet to be disappointed:
the advice is sound, the tone friendly, yet professional; and the tagline-genius.
I&#039;m glad you(guys) are more than just a web app! 

When I first started out as a freelance writer, I was 18 and had nothing that would make me desirable to a client, not even a high school diploma or GED. I had no references, no credentials, aside from a poetry blog I started as a young teenager, and only a poorly drafted resume to pawn me off as legitimate. For me, it only made sense to start looking for whatever work I could find that -- as you stated-- didn&#039;t violate my personal beliefs. 

I had never been interested in college, and since my dad ended up with no job and no savings  that same year, it was probably for the best. I was fortunate enough to have parents that valued my presence in the household, and had no intentions of kicking me out. That helped me immensely, as in the first year and a half, I took whatever job that would hire me, learning skills like SEO, adjective stuffing (don&#039;t judge,) and time management, on the fly.

I started out on Elance and Odesk, websites that provide users with opportunities to submit proposals to online &quot;classified&quot; adds. My profile started out listing my hobbies as experience, and poems as my portfolio, but what I quickly learned, was that people like samples.  

Most employers are the same way, they have a specific thing they are looking for: are you qualified? The sooner you show them you are, the better. 
And now we arrive at the paradox: If you don&#039;t have experience, you don&#039;t get work, but if you can&#039;t get  work, how do you get experience? It&#039;s simple: work anyway.

I did this by reading adds for projects I was interested in, googling industry idioms and terms I wasn&#039;t familiar with, and browsing style guides and similar articles to learn the voice they were looking for, then, I wrote my own samples. 

There&#039;s a phrase, &quot;It takes money to make money.&quot; That is technically true.
There&#039;s another phrase, &quot;Time is money.&quot; 
If you put them together, you see that time and money are often interchangeable. If you have one, it&#039;s easier to have the other. I had no money, but what I did have, was time. So I took my time, and turned it into a way to make money.

After that endeavor, I started getting hired! Amazing, I know. The hard work didn&#039;t stop there, however: they still only had my word for it. I had to do my absolute best every time, intensely editing my own work,
agreeing to unfavorable deadlines,balancing work and household chores, and spending a lot of time indoors, but after just over a year of hard work and sincere prayer, it started paying off. 

Now the clients are inviting me to jobs. The tables haven&#039;t exactly turned, but it&#039;s getting there. 
I was able to go to a writers conference in my home town this past Friday, working only a little in the lobby during lunch break.  Saturday morning I left with my dad, who now has a job as a trucker, on spur of the moment trip to Delaware, and from there, the Jersey Shore. 

As I&#039;m writing this, it is 4:08 am in Cincinnati, Ohio, I&#039;m halfway through a project due tomorrow, working from the bottom bunk of a big rig cab, and I wouldn&#039;t have it any other way.

God bless, 
Janissa Harris

P.S.
Because of wordcounter.net, I know this comment is 668 words, 3603 characters long; it&#039;s more an article than a comment, but meh, words happen.
Anyway, I owe a lot of my meager success to sites such as this. If it weren&#039;t for this site, I would likely be on a different path, and so for that I am grateful. Thank you.]]></description>
