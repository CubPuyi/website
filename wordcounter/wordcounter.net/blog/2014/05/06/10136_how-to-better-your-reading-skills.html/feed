This really is a well thought out and comprehensive article on some of the ways to increase reading skills. I think this is an undervalued part of good writing. Read, read, read!]]></description>

I can&#039;t agree more. The love of reading is instilled at a young age when kids have books read to them. Read to them more than you think you should and as often as you can. They will thank you for it when they get older.]]></description>

This is exactly what Stephen King says. If you don&#039;t have the time to read, then you don;t have the time to be a writer. The two are inseparable if you want to produce quality writing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think reading is an underappreciated aspect of good writing. The more you read, the more you understand the difference between good and poor writing. There is something you can take away from every book -- whether that be something that you want to use or something that you don&#039;t ever want to do --  to make your writing so much better. If you want to write, learn to love to read!]]></description>
