That last sentence may already have explained the difference between &#8216;allot&#8217; and &#8216;a lot&#8217; quite economically, but let&#8217;s have some fun with our words and also get around to &#8216;alot&#8217;.<\/p>\n<h2>Spoken and Informal English<\/h2>\n<p>When we speak, we seldom think about the individual words we use as much as we think about the phrases. So when you say &#8220;How are you?&#8217; you probably chose the whole phrase out of your mental linguistic archives rather than thinking about every word. It&#8217;s almost as if your brain sees the phrase as a word in itself.<\/p>\n<p>When we say phrases like this, we often run the words together so that they almost sound like one word, and that&#8217;s where a lot of English errors have their origin.<\/p>\n<h2>Is &#8220;Alot&#8221; a Word?<\/h2>\n<p>When we use English to write informally, we sometimes lump words together, even when they don&#8217;t really belong together. &#8216;Alot&#8217; is one of these, and under current English rules, it&#8217;s really incorrect. People use it to say &#8216;a lot&#8217;, and although some argue that the contraction without the space isn&#8217;t a big deal and may be accepted as correct English at some time in the future, it isn&#8217;t correct today.<\/p>\n<p>If &#8216;alot&#8217; does ever become an accepted form, it will be strictly informal. Other &#8216;lumped together&#8217; words that are accepted in informal writing are &#8216;gonna&#8217; and &#8216;wanna&#8217;, but you definitely won&#8217;t be using them in a business letter or school assignment.<\/p>\n<p>To avoid confusing your friends, &#8216;a lot&#8217; is definitely the way to go, and it means exactly the same thing &#8211; it&#8217;s the opposite of &#8216;a little bit&#8217;. So I hope you have learned a lot already, and that you won&#8217;t be using &#8216;alot&#8217; in future.<\/p>\n<h2>What Does &#8220;Allot&#8221; Mean?<\/h2>\n<p>Returning to our introduction, I said &#8220;it&#8217;s time to allot the task of explaining this trio to you&#8221; So obviously, I am using the word to describe giving a task. I could also say: &#8220;Reading my essay on <a href=\"https:\/\/wordcounter.net\/blog\/2016\/05\/16\/101630_college-admissions-essay.html\">How to Write a College Admissions Essay<\/a> is your allotted task for today.&#8221; Or I might say &#8220;I am allotting you the task of&#8230;,&#8221; or &#8220;I allot you the task of&#8230;&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>So I can use the word &#8220;allot&#8221; to share out tasks or work. I could also use it to describe something else that we&#8217;ll share: &#8220;Of the $50 we earned at our lemonade stand, I&#8217;ll allot $10 to you for your help&#8221;. It&#8217;s possible I&#8217;m being a little greedy with my profits and keeping the lion&#8217;s share, but at least I am sharing. &#8220;Allot&#8221; is a verb, but it can be turned into a noun, by adding &#8220;ment&#8221; to the end. Now we have a noun describing a thing that is shared, so an &#8220;allotment&#8221; is usually someone&#8217;s piece of a shared item such as a piece of land that has been shared between several people. An easy trick to remembering this is that &#8220;allot&#8221; indicates some kind of sharing, and sharing requires at least two people &#8212; &#8220;allot&#8221; has two &#8216;l&#8217;s&#8217;.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Allot&#8221; is quite a formal word, so you&#8217;d usually use the word &#8220;share&#8221; when you&#8217;re talking to friends about dividing up a pizza or the costs of a fun trip. It&#8217;s also perfectly correct to use &#8220;share&#8221; in most formal contexts, so if you&#8217;re not quite sure about when it would be appropriate to use &#8220;allot&#8221; use &#8220;share&#8221; instead, and you can&#8217;t really go wrong. <\/p>\n<h2>Spell Check Pitfalls<\/h2>\n<p>My computer doesn&#8217;t like it when I use &#8216;alot&#8217;. Every time I type it, auto correct shoves the space in there, and I have to go back and fix it. Once I&#8217;ve done that, spell check underlines it in red showing me that it&#8217;s a mistake. But if I were to type the word &#8220;allot&#8221; and drop one of the &#8216;l&#8217;s&#8217; by accident, it would do exactly the same thing. I&#8217;d mean &#8220;allot&#8221; but get &#8220;a lot&#8221;, and there&#8217;d be no indication from spell check that my work contained any mistakes to speak of. That&#8217;s just one example that illustrates the need for careful proofreading &#8211; even when you have spell check to help you.<\/p>\n<p>(Photo courtesy of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/linasv\/4006411720\/\">Linas V<\/a>)<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Since there is such a lot of confusion about homonyms (words that are pronounced in the same way but spelled differently such as wether, weather and whether), it&#8217;s time to allot the task of explaining this trio to you.
