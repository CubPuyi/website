Everything, but everything, is subjective. There are a lot of factors that contribute to language learning difficulties. Broadly, we could sum these up as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The language(s) you grew up speaking<\/li>\n<li>Your attitude<\/li>\n<li>Your personal context<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you grew up speaking English, learning to speak English is something you&#8217;ve been doing since you were tiny, and English seems <a href=\"https:\/\/wordcounter.net\/blog\/2016\/08\/31\/102268_simple-versus-easy.html\">easy<\/a>. Because it&#8217;s related to the Latin languages, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese shouldn&#8217;t be all that difficult to also learn, and even French makes some kind of sense. However, in all these languages, you&#8217;ll have to get around some tenses and pronunciations that come naturally to native speakers, but which will seem awkward to you.<\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll probably struggle with languages like Mandarin and Arabic because they are completely unrelated to any language you already know, and the same must be true for non-native speakers trying to learn English.<\/p>\n<p>So, is English the hardest language to learn? No. English can be difficult, but if you didn&#8217;t grow up speaking them, these languages are harder:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Mandarin<\/strong>: That tone system is difficult to master if your language doesn&#8217;t have something similar. As for the alphabet, you&#8217;re going to take quite a lot of time just learning enough of it to get by.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Finnish<\/strong>: There are cases and cases within cases, it can be really tricky to navigate.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Arabic<\/strong>: There are four variations of each of the letters, and where you use them depends on where in the word they belong.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Japanese<\/strong>: Just try that <a href=\"https:\/\/wordcounter.net\/blog\/2015\/11\/24\/10950_how-many-letters-alphabet.html\">alphabet<\/a> &#8211; there are 2,000 to 3,000 characters you must learn to have basic reading skills.<\/p>\n<h2>Why Is English Often Said to Be a Difficult Language?<\/h2>\n<p>English is packed with linguistic quirks that might even make you think they were deliberately put there just to make the language difficult to learn. Don&#8217;t take it personally. It just happened, we promise! Here&#8217;s what makes English so hard:<\/p>\n<h2>English Rules Are Hard with Multiple Exceptions<\/h2>\n<p>Just think of these inconsistencies:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The teacher <strong>taught<\/strong>. But the preacher never <strong>praught<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>One goose, two <strong>geese<\/strong>. One moose, two <strong>mooses<\/strong> (not meece)<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;<strong>Look<\/strong>&#8221; and &#8220;<strong>see<\/strong>&#8221; have similar meanings, but &#8220;<strong>overlook<\/strong>&#8221; and &#8220;<strong>oversee<\/strong>&#8221; mean completely different things.<\/li>\n<li>One mouse, two <strong>mice<\/strong>. One house, two <strong>houses<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Vegetarians<\/strong> eat vegetables, but <strong>humanitarians<\/strong> do not live on a diet of people!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure you could come up with a few more of these if you thought about it. There are rules, there are exceptions to rules, and there are exceptions to the exceptions!<\/p>\n<h2>The Correct Word Order Can Be Hard to Explain<\/h2>\n<p>Example: &#8220;It&#8217;s a little fierce cat,&#8221; versus &#8220;It&#8217;s a fierce little cat.&#8221; The second one just sounds right if you&#8217;re an English speaker, and if there&#8217;s a rule somewhere, I don&#8217;t know it. If you were to say &#8220;It&#8217;s a big fierce cat,&#8221; it wouldn&#8217;t sound wrong at all.<\/p>\n<p>I sometimes collaborate with a Dutch lady who is an excellent researcher, but I always have to change her wording. If I know why, I add a comment so that she can learn, but quite often, I can&#8217;t explain why I made certain changes.<\/p>\n<h2>Weird spelling<\/h2>\n<p>English has its roots in many languages, and some <a href=\"https:\/\/wordcounter.net\/blog\/2016\/08\/01\/102080_common-misspellings.html\">spellings<\/a> seem to have little to do with the way you pronounce a word. Just think of &#8220;yacht.&#8221; It&#8217;s pronounced &#8220;yot,&#8221; but that&#8217;s not what the letters tell us! Other weird ones include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Through<\/li>\n<li>Bough<\/li>\n<li>Rough<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>All three end in &#8220;ough&#8221; but they are pronounced as &#8220;Thru,&#8221; &#8220;Bow,&#8221; and &#8220;Ruff&#8221; &#8212; are we crazy?<\/p>\n<p>Then there are silent letters like the &#8220;h&#8221; in &#8220;Ghost&#8221; and the &#8220;b&#8221; in &#8220;Debt.&#8221; And as for the letter &#8220;c,&#8221; it can&#8217;t decide whether it should be pronounced as an &#8220;s&#8221; or like a &#8220;k.&#8221; While we&#8217;re at it, by what logic did we decide some words end in &#8220;ck?&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2>Inflection Changes Meaning &#8211; at Least a Bit<\/h2>\n<p>Am I kidding? No, I am not! The words you place emphasis on can change the meaning of a sentence, even if it&#8217;s only slightly. Let&#8217;s look at an example<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I know I got that letter.&#8221; Easy peasy. It&#8217;s a simple statement of fact.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;<strong>I<\/strong> know I got that letter.&#8221; Place emphasis on the I, and suddenly you&#8217;re implying that someone else might not believe you or doesn&#8217;t know what you know.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I <strong>know<\/strong> I got that letter.&#8221; Now you&#8217;re wondering what happened to the letter, because despite the fact that you know you got it, you can&#8217;t seem to find it.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I know I got <strong>that<\/strong> letter.&#8221; Here you&#8217;re saying you received a letter, but another one didn&#8217;t turn up.<\/p>\n<h2>Regional Accents<\/h2>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure this is true of other widely spoken languages too, but pity the person who has to learn English. English speakers from around the world might often sound like they&#8217;re speaking completely different languages! We even have difficulty talking to each other sometimes.<\/p>\n<p>When I was at school, we were very excited and interested when an Australian girl joined our class. There was just one problem<a href=\"https:\/\/wordcounter.net\/blog\/2016\/06\/24\/101812_capitalize-words-colon-semi-colon.html\">:<\/a> none of us could understand a word she said! Closer to home, the US has many regional accents, and we can have difficulty communicating with our own countrymen and women.<\/p>\n<h2>English May Not Be the Hardest Language, but&#8230;<\/h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;re an English speaker, don&#8217;t mock others who struggle with your language. Who knows? One day, you might find yourself in a position where you must learn theirs. Struggling with the complexities of English (and there are plenty) doesn&#8217;t mean someone is stupid, and you should always encourage people to study new languages.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When we try to decide which language is the hardest to learn, we have a problem.
