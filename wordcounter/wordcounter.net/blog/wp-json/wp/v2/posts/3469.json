No doubt, your schoolteachers gave you rules to stick to in class. But out in the real world, there\u2019s more leeway than you may have realized.<\/p>\n<p>Not to worry. You don\u2019t need a master\u2019s degree in publishing to be a good writer. If you follow these four tips anytime you write and edit, you\u2019ll be able to turn out a quality email, report, or article.<\/p>\n<h2>1. Be consistent<\/h2>\n<p>Some aspects of good writing are rules. Others are style choices. So how can you tell which is which?<\/p>\n<p>The easiest way is to <strong>pick and follow a style guide<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>There are many style guides for English: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.apstylebook.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AP<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/apastyle.apa.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">APA<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.chicagomanualofstyle.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CMOS<\/a> (a.k.a., <strong>Chicago<\/strong>), <a href=\"https:\/\/style.mla.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MLA<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ox.ac.uk\/public-affairs\/style-guide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Oxford<\/a> &#8230; It depends what country you\u2019re writing for and what you\u2019re writing about. If you\u2019re writing within a school or company, you may be asked to follow what\u2019s called a <strong>house<\/strong> style guide, that is, a guide created specifically for that entity. Some newspapers like The Economist or The Guardian even stick to their own.<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Style guide name (Short form):<\/strong><\/td>\n<td><strong>Target audience:<\/strong><\/td>\n<td><strong>Used in:<\/strong><\/td>\n<td><strong>Notes:<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>AP<\/td>\n<td>American journalists and reporters<\/td>\n<td>News, media, broadcasting, magazine publishing, marketing, and public relations.<\/td>\n<td>The most popular style for casual writing and anything online. Most bloggers use this style.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>APA<\/td>\n<td>Students, academics, professionals<\/td>\n<td>Agriculture, biology, business, chemistry, education, language and linguistics, nursing, psychology, social and behavioral sciences.<\/td>\n<td>Focuses on clarity of communication and &#8220;word choice that best reduces bias in language&#8221;.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CMOS<\/td>\n<td>Academic publishers, book editors and authors, fiction writers<\/td>\n<td>Humanities, social, historical and political sciences.<\/td>\n<td>Specifically focuses on American English. <em>Turabian<\/em> follows CMOS.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>MLA<\/td>\n<td>Students and researchers<\/td>\n<td>Arts and humanities, especially English, writing, literature, and related subjects like theater or film.<\/td>\n<td>Focuses on brevity and clarity.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Oxford<\/td>\n<td>Oxford University staff, British students and writers.<\/td>\n<td>An in-house guide that has grown into a general writing guide for students and editors.<\/td>\n<td>Also known as &#8220;New Hart&#8217;s Rules&#8221;.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3>1.1 Which style guide should you pick?<\/h3>\n<p>In the best case: the style that your readership considers correct.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, this is not always possible. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s important to get into your readers&#8217; heads. For example, if the target audience of your text is teachers or professors, they will prefer the CMOS style to the AP style. For most other people, however, AP is more appropriate. This is true not only for people who write in AP style every day, such as journalists and PR professionals but also for people who don&#8217;t care what stylebook you use. Most online articles the average person reads on a daily basis are in AP style. If you stick to that they will most likely consider it &#8220;correct.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h3>1.2 Guidelines evolve<\/h3>\n<p>What\u2019s more, some rules and guidelines change with the times. For example, until 2019, \u201cAfrican-American\u201d took a hyphen per the AP Stylebook. Today, you\u2019d write it without the hyphen: \u201cAfrican American.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to keep up with style guide updates, which are sometimes issued as often as annually.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t worry too much if learning the details of a certain style sounds complicated. Once you\u2019re familiar with your style guide, many aspects of the English language are unlikely to change. For example, sentences will always end with one of three punctuation marks: a period, an exclamation point, or a question mark.<\/p>\n<p>By getting a solid grasp of grammar rules as well as familiarizing yourself with style choices, you\u2019ll be on the road to rockstar writing in no time.<\/p>\n<p>For a comparison of AP and Chicago, check out our post <a href=\"https:\/\/wordcounter.net\/blog\/2018\/03\/26\/103228_cmos-vs-ap.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>1.3 Oxford comma yes or no?<\/h3>\n<p>Last but not least, you might wonder, whether you should use the Oxford comma (also called the serial comma).<\/p>\n<p>You can read more about it <a href=\"https:\/\/wordcounter.net\/blog\/2019\/04\/30\/103328_oxford-comma-2.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>2. Use the active voice<\/h2>\n<p>In English, sentences typically follow the subject\u2013verb\u2013object pattern: \u201cEmilio caught the ball.\u201d This sentence is written in the active voice, meaning the subject is acting on the object.<\/p>\n<p>However, you could also write, \u201cThe ball was caught by Emilio.\u201d This sentence conveys the same idea, but it\u2019s written in the passive voice. The object has become the subject.<\/p>\n<p>Although there are cases in which passive voice can work well or even better than the active voice, most of the time, active voice is usually preferable. <strong>Why?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For one thing, the active voice takes more words to say the same thing. If you\u2019re keen to keep your readers\u2019 eyes from tiring or save space, active voice rules.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, passive voice can sound vague. Take, for example, the following sentence: \u201cThe vase was smashed.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Who exactly smashed the vase? We don\u2019t know. That\u2019s why the passive voice is used in certain instances where the writer wants to eliminate tagging a subject with responsibility. Examples include law and science.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Punctuate right<\/h2>\n<p>Punctuation marks can make a huge difference in meaning when stringing words together in a sentence. But getting punctuation right can be tricky.<\/p>\n<p>Although you probably learned the basics of punctuation in grade school, there\u2019s more to the marks than what you likely learned. That\u2019s because like most aspects of the English language, punctuation is both art and science.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a list of the basics.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Apostrophes<\/strong> make contractions and show possession.<\/p>\n<p>No, you cant eat Sashas\u2019 pie. (<span style=\"color: red;\">\u2717<\/span>)<br \/>\nNo, you can\u2019t eat Sasha\u2019s pie. (<span style=\"color: green;\">\u2713<\/span>)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Colons<\/strong> introduce important information. They\u2019re a way to say, \u201cNow hear this!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The reception menu includes: fish, chicken, and a vegetarian dish. (<span style=\"color: red;\">\u2717<\/span>)<br \/>\nThe reception menu includes fish, chicken, and a vegetarian dish.

(<span style=\"color: green;\">\u2713<\/span>)<\/p>\n<p>Keep in mind that colons are used differently in American and British English, so again, check your style guide.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Commas<\/strong> indicate pauses between words, phrases, and ideas. There\u2019s an ongoing debate between people who prefer serial, or Oxford, commas and people who don\u2019t. The important thing is to pick an approach and stick to it.<\/p>\n<p>I need tape, paper, and markers. (<span style=\"color: green;\">\u2713<\/span>)<br \/>\nI need tape, paper and markers. (<span style=\"color: green;\">\u2713<\/span>)<\/p>\n<p>The president introduced his wife Janice.

Then we saw a movie. (<span style=\"color: green;\">\u2713<\/span>)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Dashes<\/strong> come in different styles to serve different purposes.

Separate soundalikes<\/h2>\n<p>The English language contains many words that sound like other words but mean something entirely different. These words are called <strong>homophones<\/strong>, and even current spellcheckers don\u2019t always know the difference.
