The question trips up even grammar-lovers. And in many circles, <em>whom<\/em> is becoming obsolete, which may sadden grammar purists.<\/p>\n<p>Although <em>who<\/em> and <em>whom<\/em> are similar, each serves a distinct purpose. In order to understand how to use these pronouns correctly, you\u2019ll have to refresh yourself on sentence structure.<\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve got this down and compared several examples, you\u2019ll be able to remember how to use <em>who<\/em> and <em>whom<\/em> quite easily.<\/p>\n<h2>Parts of a sentence: a quick refresher<\/h2>\n<p>The basic parts of a sentence are the subject and the predicate. The predicate must include a verb but may also include an object.<\/p>\n<p>The subject is the person or thing that acts. The verb describes the action. The object is the person or thing that\u2019s acted upon by a verb or preposition.<\/p>\n<p>Clearly, sentences can get far more complicated than this. But this is the basic structure of a sentence.<\/p>\n<p>In English, the standard order of a declarative sentence, or statement, is subject\u2014verb\u2014object. For example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tyrone bought the pizza.<\/li>\n<li>Maria likes Jorge.<\/li>\n<li>My children are watching TV.<\/li>\n<li>The Kahdims are my neighbors.<\/li>\n<li>Our boss called the police.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We\u2019re going to come back to these sentences further along as we explain <em>who<\/em> versus <em>whom<\/em>.<\/p>\n<h2>Who<\/h2>\n<p><em>Who<\/em> is a pronoun that replaces or refers to the singular or plural subject of a sentence. <em>Who<\/em> can be used in a question or a statement.<\/p>\n<p>This famous book title by Stieg Larsson includes <em>who<\/em>:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe Girl Who Kicked the Hornet\u2019s Nest\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Now, look at this headline:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cCouple who missed Royal Caribbean cruise in viral video was celebrating honeymoon\u201d<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/travel\/couple-who-missed-royal-caribbean-cruise-in-bahamas-was-on-honeymoon-traveler-reveals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fox News<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Here are some other examples of how to use <em>who<\/em> in a sentence:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Who do you think you are?<\/li>\n<li>I wonder who\u2019s at the door.<\/li>\n<li>Who wants to go swimming?<\/li>\n<li>Tell me who did this.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Now, let\u2019s go back to our original examples and use who to form a question from each statement.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Who bought the pizza? (<em>Who<\/em> replaces \u201cTyrone.\u201d)<\/li>\n<li>Who likes Jorge? (<em>Who<\/em> replaces \u201cMaria.\u201d)<\/li>\n<li>Who\u2019s watching TV? (<em>Who<\/em> replaces \u201cmy children.\u201d)<\/li>\n<li>Who are your neighbors? (<em>Who<\/em> replaces \u201cthe Kahdims,\u201d the subject\u2014not \u201cneighbors,\u201d the object.)<\/li>\n<li>Who called the police? (<em>Who<\/em> replaces \u201cour boss.\u201d)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We\u2019ll take the idea further and develop the original examples into statements that relate to or directly answer the questions above.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>I never found out who bought the pizza.<\/li>\n<li>I don\u2019t care who likes Jorge.<\/li>\n<li>You tell me who\u2019s watching TV!<\/li>\n<li>I didn\u2019t ask who your neighbors are.<\/li>\n<li>I know who called the police.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To recap, who replaces or refers to the subject of a sentence.<\/p>\n<h2>Whom<\/h2>\n<p><em>Whom<\/em> is a pronoun that replaces the singular or plural object of a sentence. <em>Whom<\/em> can be used in a question or a statement.<\/p>\n<p>One of the most famous uses of <em>whom<\/em> is in this classic book title by Ernest Hemingway:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFor Whom the Bell Tolls\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Now, look at this headline:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cA Singer for Whom Words Always Came First\u201d<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2019\/02\/06\/arts\/music\/sanford-sylvan-appraisal.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The New York Times<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Right away, you can probably sense a difference between <em>whom<\/em> and <em>who<\/em>, even if you can\u2019t put your finger on it.<\/p>\n<p>In these two examples, <em>whom<\/em> is followed by a preposition, but this isn\u2019t always the case. With a direct object, a preposition isn\u2019t necessary.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll also notice that a clause (a sentencelike phrase including both a subject and a verb) follows <em>whom<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s look at using <em>whom<\/em> in a sentence. Here are some examples:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>To whom am I speaking?<\/li>\n<li>Whom are you calling?<\/li>\n<li>Don\u2019t tell me whom to spend time with!<\/li>\n<li>With whom did you dance?<\/li>\n<li>Whom did the factory hire?<\/li>\n<li>I have no idea whom I\u2019ll marry.<\/li>\n<li>By whom is he standing?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Let\u2019s go back to our original sentences. We\u2019ll expand one of them:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Maria likes Jorge.<\/li>\n<li>My children are watching TV with Nana.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To turn these sentences into questions, note the different uses of <em>who<\/em> and <em>whom<\/em>. First:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Who likes Jorge?<\/li>\n<li>Whom does Maria like?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Who\u2019s watching TV with Nana?<\/li>\n<li>With whom are your children watching TV?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>But also:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Who\u2019s watching TV with your children?<\/li>\n<li>With whom is Nana watching TV?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To recap, <em>whom<\/em> replaces or refers to the object of a verb or preposition.<\/p>\n<h2>The modern use of <em>who<\/em><\/h2>\n<p>In casual conversations today, you\u2019ll hear things like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Who are your kids watching TV with?<\/li>\n<li>Who did Tyrone buy the pizza for?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This is one of those lazy-grammar habits that\u2019s become marginally acceptable in speech and even in some writing. But if you want to be taken seriously and to come across smartly in your writing, it\u2019s always better to use <em>whom<\/em> when it\u2019s called for.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, <a href=\"https:\/\/afterdeadline.blogs.nytimes.com\/2015\/09\/29\/the-case-of-who-v-whom-2\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The New York Times<\/a> addressed this who\u2013whom laziness, or perhaps ignorance, in a 2015 blog post. You\u2019d do well to follow their lead.<\/p>\n<h2>How to use <em>who<\/em> and <em>whom<\/em> correctly<\/h2>\n<p>Both pronouns can be used in questions or statements.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Who<\/em> replaces the subject of a sentence.<\/li>\n<li><em>Whom<\/em> replaces the object of a sentence.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>An easy way to determine if you should use <em>who<\/em> or <em>whom<\/em> is to see if <em>he<\/em> or <em>him<\/em> fits into the sentence. (Of course, <em>she<\/em> and <em>her<\/em> work too, but <em>he<\/em> and <em>him<\/em> sound more like <em>who<\/em> and <em>whom<\/em>, so it\u2019s a simpler test.)<\/p>\n<p>For example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>He bought this book. &gt; Who bought this book?<\/li>\n<li>Him bought this book. &gt; Nope!<\/li>\n<li>I gave the book to he. &gt; Nope!<\/li>\n<li>I gave the book to him. &gt; To whom did you give the book?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In casual speech and writing, <em>whom<\/em> is becoming somewhat obsolete. But for formal speech and writing, always use <em>whom<\/em> when it\u2019s called for.<\/p>\n<p>Note that if you\u2019re developing a story character who\u2019s young or doesn\u2019t have an advanced education, your character likely won\u2019t be throwing <em>whom<\/em> around in their dialogue.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re writing anything else, stick with <em>whom<\/em> \u2026 so a bell doesn\u2019t toll for your reputation.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Who or whom?
