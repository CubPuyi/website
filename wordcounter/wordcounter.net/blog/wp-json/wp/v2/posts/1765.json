Part of the problem is there are times you do and times you don&#8217;t, and sometimes the difference between the two isn&#8217;t readily apparent. In other words, the answer is &#8220;it depends.&#8221; For those who are looking for a general rule of thumb, the answer to the question, &#8220;When do you capitalize directions?&#8221; the answer is <strong>You capitalize north, east, south and west when they&#8217;re part of a proper name, but you don&#8217;t if they only indicate direction<\/strong>. <\/p>\n<p>Chances are that one of the reasons you&#8217;re here is that you&#8217;ve noticed that you sometimes see directions capitalized, while at other times you don&#8217;t. The question is, how do you know when you should be using the capital letter?<\/p>\n<h2>Directions: north, south, east and west<\/h2>\n<p>When you&#8217;re using a direction to describe nothing but the direction, lower case letters are the ones to choose. For example, if you say &#8220;The sun is weakest on the north side (or northern side)&#8221; lower case letters are fine. In this case, your are using the word &#8220;north&#8221; to show orientation of the sun, and  you&#8217;re not using the direction as a proper name. On a side note, the directions in the title of this article are capitalized due to <a href=\"https:\/\/headlinecapitalization.com\/\">headline capitalization rules<\/a> even though they merely indicate direction. <\/p>\n<p>As soon as you start using directions as part of a proper name, they get capitalized. It&#8217;s similar to why your name is always capitalized. So, if a person is from South Africa, south would be capitalized since it&#8217;s the proper name of the country. When you&#8217;re talking about America&#8217;s West Coast or the Middle East, the directional word is also part of a proper name, and it gets a capital letter. Sometimes, people abbreviate these names which can make it a bit more confusing. For example, you could say a person is from the West or the East meaning they are from the West Coast or the East Coast in the US. Even though you don&#8217;t spell it out completely, you still use a capital letter.<\/p>\n<p>To put it in another way that may make it easier to understand, talking about a region, such as Western Europe, means capitals are used. On the other hand, if you tell someone to go south along the freeway, that&#8217;s just a direction, and it gets a lowercase letter. This may seem pretty straightforward, but there are times when there is a debate as to whether or not the direction is just a direction, or if it&#8217;s a proper name.<\/p>\n<p>Not everyone agrees on <a href=\"https:\/\/wordcounter.net\/blog\/2016\/06\/15\/101736_wether-weather-whether.html\">whether<\/a> you should capitalize the direction in a sentence like, &#8220;As a Southerner, he had a distinctive drawl.&#8221; Some say that you&#8217;re talking about someone who is from a particular region, and that a capital letter should be used. Others argue it&#8217;s just a direction of the place the person lives and doesn&#8217;t get a capital letter. I&#8217;m inclined to think that the &#8216;regional&#8217; opinion is spot on, but this is an example of how differing opinions can lead to one person using a capital letter while another would use a lowercase letter for direction in the same sentence. <\/p>\n<p>(Photo courtesy of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/pe5pe\/3879235872\/\">Luis Perez<\/a>)<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When it comes to the question of directions, there&#8217;s often quite a bit of confusion as to whether or not you should capitalize the directions north, south, east and west.
