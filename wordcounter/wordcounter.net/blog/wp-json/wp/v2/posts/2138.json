Here&#8217;s a true story. When I first began to use e-mail, people kept typing &#8220;LOL&#8221; in their responses. One day, I asked one of them what LOL actually meant, and they got back with &#8220;Laughs out loud!&#8221; I must have been feeling a bit grouchy that day because I responded: &#8220;No need to be sarcastic, pal, just TELL me!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>I kid you not. Since then, I have developed my own range of obscure text acronyms as a secret form of revenge. Try these if you like. Unless people have been writing to me, they will surely be baffled:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>CHKL = chuckle<\/li>\n<li>GGL = giggle<\/li>\n<li>GFW = guffaw<\/li>\n<li>TTR = titter<\/li>\n<li>SNRT = snort<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>But we&#8217;re not here to discuss my off-the-wall, obscure text acronyms. Instead, we&#8217;ll talk about the other kind &#8211; the ones people use a whole lot.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>AAAAA = American Association against Acronym Abuse. I&#8217;m joining! Where do I sign up?<\/li>\n<li><strong>B2B = business to business<\/strong>. There are various permutations: B2C (consumer), B2A (anyone), B2G (government)&#8230; you get the picture.<\/li>\n<li><strong>BF = best friend or boyfriend<\/strong>. Guys, be careful with this one unless you actually do have a boyfriend. If you do, that&#8217;s just fine. If you don&#8217;t&#8230; well, just saying.<\/li>\n<li><strong>BFF = best friends forever<\/strong>. Someone, please bring me a barf bag.<\/li>\n<li><strong>BRB = be right back<\/strong>. I&#8217;m always tempted to tell people who use this not to break wind in my presence without at least excusing themselves.<\/li>\n<li><strong>BTW = by the way<\/strong>. Sigh. Guilty. I use it. I hate myself, but I still use it.<\/li>\n<li><strong>FOMO = fear of missing out<\/strong>. And sadly, that&#8217;s why I try to keep up with these things. I seriously don&#8217;t want another &#8220;lol&#8221; incident!<\/li>\n<li><strong>FWIW = for what it&#8217;s worth<\/strong>. A lot like IMHO, see below.<\/li>\n<li><strong>FYI = for your information<\/strong>. Alternative interpretation: &#8220;waste of time, ignore it.&#8221;<\/li>\n<li><strong>GIGO = garbage in, garbage out<\/strong>. I think it may predate text speak, but I prefer the long form. Call me old-fashioned and see if I care.<\/li>\n<li><strong>ICYMI = in case you missed it<\/strong>. Yes. I missed it. If you had written that out in full, I wouldn&#8217;t have.<\/li>\n<li><strong>ILY = I love you<\/strong>. Please slap anyone who can&#8217;t be bothered to use the full form. Really!<\/li>\n<li><strong>IMO = in my opinion<\/strong>. At least it doesn&#8217;t even pretend to be humble.<\/li>\n<li><strong>IMHO = in my humble opinion<\/strong>, and believe me, it&#8217;s never humble. People who say &#8220;IMHO&#8221; are just plain opinionated.<\/li>\n<li><strong>IRL = in real life<\/strong>. You can just tell someone is going to say something annoyingly patronizing when they use that one.<\/li>\n<li><strong>MSG = message<\/strong>. I always thought it stood for &#8220;monosodium glutamate.&#8221; See how ignorant I am?<\/li>\n<li><strong>NP = no problem<\/strong>. Again, it&#8217;s infectious. The proper response would be LTT (Learn to type &#8211; another of my creations), but I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;m one of the culprits.<\/li>\n<li><strong>OMG = oh my god<\/strong>. Guilty! I even say &#8220;OMG&#8221; sometimes. It&#8217;s invariably followed by a sense of self-loathing.<\/li>\n<li><strong>TMI = too much information<\/strong>. Well, if the phrase &#8220;too much information&#8221; is something you can&#8217;t get your head around, no bloody wonder.<\/li>\n<li><strong>TTYL = talk to you later<\/strong>. OMG if you are going to TTML in that tone of acronym, I&#8217;m not sure if I will handle it.<\/li>\n<li><strong>TX, THX or THKS = thanks<\/strong>. Now IMHO, if you&#8217;re going to use four of the six letters the word &#8220;thanks&#8221; consists of, you may as well LTT and include the two vowels. As for the &#8216;X&#8217; let&#8217;s not even go there! #LTS = learn to spell!<\/li>\n<li><strong>TXT = text<\/strong>. I don&#8217;t think that saving one letter is worth it, but there it is.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Of course, this is just a broad sampling. Digits are (unfortunately) popular, particularly 4 (for) and 2 (to), so we have 2nite, 2day, 2morrow, 4U, B4, 4eva&#8230; the hair on the back of my neck is rising, my nails are growing longer, a deep-throated growl is rising up from my belly. Aha! H2O! A sure-fire way to cool down.<\/p>\n<p>But just try telling me &#8220;ILY 4eva&#8221;, and I swear, I&#8217;ll have a hissy fit that&#8217;s second to none and go looking for someone with more poetry in their soul and the ability to spell. FWIW it&#8217;s entirely possible I&#8217;m the only one who doesn&#8217;t think these things are cute which is why I am patronizing you with this particular blog post. Then again, you&#8217;re actually reading it, so perhaps you are also mystified by text abbreviations.<\/p>\n<p>You may notice that I didn&#8217;t include favorites such as &#8220;WTF,&#8221; but I dislike excessive use of asterisks almost as much as I dislike text acronyms, so most of the acronyms containing the letter F have been excluded. I will leave them up to your imagination.<\/p>\n<p>(Photo courtesy of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/jonasb\/3089885127\/\">Jonas Bengtsson<\/a>)<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I&#8217;m not a lover of text acronyms.
