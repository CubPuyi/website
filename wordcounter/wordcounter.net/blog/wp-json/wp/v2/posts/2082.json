The aim of this article is to de-fog the fogginess surrounding these two (we&#8217;ve already done so with <a href=\"https:\/\/wordcounter.net\/blog\/2016\/03\/21\/101072_when-to-use-was-versus-were.html\">was vs were<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/wordcounter.net\/blog\/2016\/01\/18\/101070_further-away-versus-farther-away.html\">further away vs farther away<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/wordcounter.net\/blog\/2016\/03\/28\/101162_onto-vs-on-to.html\">onto vs on to<\/a>). One of these forms is correct, and the other is just plain wrong. Would anyone care to lay bets before we continue by explaining which is which?<\/p>\n<h2>&#8220;Each&#8221; Refers to How Many?<\/h2>\n<p>To get the answer we&#8217;re looking for, we should begin by looking at the word &#8220;each.&#8221; It automatically implies that we are talking about one of the following: a single object or person, a group of things, or people that can be regarded as a unit.<\/p>\n<p>To put this more clearly, you wouldn&#8217;t use a pluralized word after &#8220;each.&#8221; You may say &#8220;each animal has unique markings,&#8221; but you would never say &#8220;each animals have unique markings.&#8221; If you were to modify the sentence to &#8220;Each of the animals has unique markings,&#8221; we&#8217;re once again looking at a single animal at a time.<\/p>\n<p>You could talk about &#8220;each people,&#8221; but then you would be talking about individual races, which turns the word &#8220;people&#8221; into a singular that could be pluralized as &#8220;peoples.&#8221; For example: &#8220;Each people has its own culture,&#8221; means that the French culture differs from the German culture, and so on. It would be a slightly odd way of expressing the idea, but it wouldn&#8217;t be wrong because in the example &#8220;people&#8221; is singular.<\/p>\n<p>The bottom line with all of this? As soon as you see the word &#8220;each,&#8221; the word following it needs to be in its singular form.<\/p>\n<h2>&#8220;Other&#8221; Refers to How Many?<\/h2>\n<p>Because we have prefixed &#8220;other&#8221; with &#8220;each&#8221; it has to remain in the singular form. While there is a plural form for &#8220;other&#8221; which is &#8220;others,&#8221; it differs from the example of &#8220;people&#8221; since it has no alternative meaning and cannot be pluralized yet again.<\/p>\n<p>Returning to that example, we could say that &#8220;people&#8221; means a whole lot of persons, or we could use it to indicate race: &#8220;The Turks are a people who love their coffee. The Turks and the Greeks are two peoples who have often been at war.&#8221; There is no such alternative meaning for &#8220;others.&#8221; It&#8217;s the plural form of &#8220;other&#8221; and that&#8217;s all there is to it.<\/p>\n<h2>Sticking to the Rule<\/h2>\n<p>The rule is that &#8220;each&#8221; will always be followed by a singular. &#8220;John and Mary promised to love each other forever. They agreed to take care of each other&#8217;s wellbeing above all else.&#8221; The apostrophe is used to indicate possession, and it comes before the s, not after it.<\/p>\n<p>If we don&#8217;t prefix &#8220;other&#8221; with &#8220;each&#8221;, we can use it in the plural form. &#8220;You need to learn to respect others&#8217; views,&#8221; but as soon as the magic &#8220;each&#8221; enters the equation, &#8220;You need to learn to respect each other&#8217;s views,&#8221; is the correct form. Don&#8217;t be confused by the word &#8220;we,&#8221; even though it does indicate more than one person: &#8220;We need to learn to respect each other&#8217;s views&#8221; is correct as long as we use the singular forms of &#8220;other&#8221; after the word &#8220;each.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2>Another Example<\/h2>\n<p>Here are two more permutations: &#8220;We need to respect one another&#8217;s views,&#8221; and &#8220;We need to respect others&#8217; views.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;One another&#8221; is really just another way of saying &#8220;Each other.&#8221; But if we leave out the word that indicates a singular (&#8220;one&#8221; or &#8220;each&#8221;), we can use the apostrophe after the s because we are now talking about multiple others simultaneously.<\/p>\n<h2>No Need for Confusion<\/h2>\n<p>Just remember the simple rule about the word following &#8220;each&#8221; and you&#8217;ll never get &#8220;each other&#8217;s&#8221; wrong again. Now, to the important business at hand. Who lost the bet I invited you to make at the beginning of this piece?
