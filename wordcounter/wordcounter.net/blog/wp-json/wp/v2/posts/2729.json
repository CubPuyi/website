There are plenty of sources to generate inspiration and helpful tips in the year to come.<\/p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t know the adage that says writers should be readers too, it&#8217;s time you made it your own, and since you love writing, reading about writing makes absolute sense. You can get tips, tricks and ideas and become part of a community of aspiring writers who share their daily challenges and inspirations.<\/p>\n<p>Writing blogs come in almost as many genres as stories.

Whatever your interest in writing, you&#8217;re sure to find a good a match.<\/p>\n<p>But how will you find really good writer&#8217;s&#8217;blogs? If you&#8217;re a blogger already, you&#8217;ll know that the blogosphere is full of aspiring writers and poets, and sad to say, few of them are any good?

Plus, great blogs attract paid advertising, sponsorships, and opportunities for affiliate marketing. Yup, it&#8217;s salesy, but if you want a popular blog, knowing how to sell it is essential! This said, you might decide that the one to two sentence paragraphs that permeate the site won&#8217;t do for your book. You&#8217;re right! But they will work well on your blog&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.livewritethrive.com\/about\/\">Live Write Thrive<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Would you like to get a view of writing from an editor&#8217;s perspective?

Yes, she writes books about writing, and she&#8217;s written a few novels too, but she isn&#8217;t going to market you to death. There&#8217;s some really useful content there, and despite browsing her blog for minutes (I&#8217;m being honest here), I didn&#8217;t see a single pop up ad, download or sign up invitation. Yes, she does promote her books, but it seems she&#8217;s quite happy to sum up what&#8217;s in them in her blogs. I found the posts I read insightful, and I believe I&#8217;ll be back for more.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.thecreativepenn.com\/about\/\">The Creative Penn<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Thriller writer Joanna Penn is a bestselling author who has also penned (Oh, the temptation to pun!) numerous &#8220;how to&#8221; books on writing and public speaking, and offers creative writing courses. As you&#8217;d expect, there&#8217;s a strong commercial element to her blog, but I didn&#8217;t find it too in your face, and there were some real gems among her tips and tricks.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.stevenpressfield.com\/about\/\">Steven Pressfield Online<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Steven writes historical fiction with a warlike flavor. Chances are, you&#8217;ll have heard about his books or read them at one time or another, and he writes like a true warrior. He hosts several bloggers, but the overarching theme is a gritty tone. As an example, the blog header image currently reads, &#8220;Nobody wants to read your sh*t.&#8221; If you&#8217;re looking for writers who write about writing without pulling their punches, this is the place to be!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.makealivingwriting.com\/about-carol\/\">Make a Living Writing<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Carol Tice is hardworking freelance writer who doesn&#8217;t believe we should be swallowing content mill rates. I like her already! Her blog is full of tips for those who want to make a living through their writing and actually get a fairly decent wage out of it. As a freelance writer, I can vouch for her tips. Follow her for inspiration and ideas that will help you to earn decent money for your writing.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.brainpickings.org\/about\/\">Brain Pickings<\/a><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s ad free and interesting. The blog features a lot of information and advice from the greatest writers of our time, and several who were before it. Who is behind it? Maria Popova who says the blog &#8220;is my one-woman labor of love \u2014 a subjective lens on what matters in the world and why.&#8221; There&#8217;s plenty of food for thought. Don&#8217;t choose it for an easy read, though. The prose is pretty highbrow.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/jodyhedlund.com\/about-jody\/my-writing-journey\/\">Jody Hedlund<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Here we have another busy, bestselling author. Much of what she shares is sheer inspiration rather than technical tips, but hey, sometimes inspiration and the will to get up and go on in the face of adversity is what we need most. Jody didn&#8217;t have an easy path to publication, but today, she&#8217;s so busy that her blog posts are rather irregular. Still, when she finds the time to write, her posts have value to writers who hope to emulate her success.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.thewritersalleyblog.com\/p\/about-shopkeepers.html\">The Writers&#8217; Alley<\/a><\/p>\n<p>As long as you aren&#8217;t expecting anything too secular or irreverent, you might enjoy the Writers&#8217; Alley. The blog is administered by a group of 11 published authors who are also dedicated Christians, and the blog combines spirituality with emotion and tech tips. If you&#8217;re not into spirituality and emotion, it isn&#8217;t for you, but if you are, you are going to love it!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/writersinthestormblog.com\/about\/\">Writers in the Storm<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Three published authors, one blog. They write about what it&#8217;s like handling deadlines, tackling author branding, juggling kids and writing and more.

As someone who has been there, done that, and is still doing that, I approached her blog with skepticism, but she&#8217;s offering some quality information. Even if you don&#8217;t choose to use her as an agent, she&#8217;ll give you some useful tips. She shoots from the hip, and yes, it sounds a little rough in places, but that&#8217;s just how it is.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/menwithpens.ca\/about\/\">Men with Pens<\/a><\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re starting out as freelance writer, you&#8217;ll find this blog inspiring. If you&#8217;ve been at it for a while, it may raise an eyebrow. I didn&#8217;t agree with everything I read here, but I thought overall it gave relatively good advice. There&#8217;s some good stuff on landing new jobs, but also an assumption that you NEED them. Um. I can&#8217;t agree there. Sell more time than you have and you end up subcontracting. Believe me, that way madness lies! Still, it&#8217;s a good blog for those who aren&#8217;t writing their magnum opus but would like to <a href=\"https:\/\/wordcounter.net\/blog\/2014\/05\/09\/105_make-money-writing.html\">make some money from writing<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/writerswrite.co.za\/pages\/contact-us\">Writers Write<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Yes, it does sell writing courses. No, it doesn&#8217;t hide all the good stuff till you pay. There&#8217;s a lot of good technical information on the blog, and the writers have done their best to keep it entertaining. Even if you don&#8217;t sign up with the courses, it&#8217;s worthwhile following the blog because it addresses a lot of the &#8220;how to&#8221; questions that plague writers!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/terribleminds.com\/ramble\/blog\/\">Terrible Minds<\/a><\/p>\n<p>I love it! It&#8217;s cynical, hard hitting and unconventional. That&#8217;s just what you want when following a published author with a blog called &#8220;Terrible Minds.&#8221; Chuck Wendig writes like a true genius, so even if you don&#8217;t agree with his blog posts, you&#8217;ll find them stimulating, and against his will, inspiring.

It&#8217;s a borrower, in that it quotes some of the best work on any given theme. Until you realize that, it may seem rather a strange read, but once you get used to the compilation style, the penny drops. Because it credits its sources, you&#8217;ll find other websites and blogs worth visiting too.
