Nov. 2021)"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>If you\u2019re a student or professional writer, you\u2019re likely familiar with English style guides. Although you learned many rights and wrongs in your English classes, not every aspect of the language is black or white.<\/p>\n<p>Many style guides exist for English, and each serves a different role. Students may be familiar with APA or MLA style, which we don\u2019t cover in this post. Nor will we cover <em>The Gregg Reference Manual<\/em>, a common resource for business writing, or British styles such as Oxford.<br \/>\nIn this article, we\u2019ll highlight two American style guides: <em>The Chicago Manual of Style<\/em> and the <em>AP Stylebook<\/em>. We\u2019ll cover six categories: punctuation, capitalization, numbers, abbreviations, spelling and specific words, and formatting.<\/p>\n<p>But first, find out how you can strengthen your understanding of style guides and good English.<\/p>\n<h1><strong>What\u2019s the difference between Chicago and AP?<\/strong><\/h1>\n<p>These are two of the most popular style guides for professional writers. Since 1906, Chicago has been the go-to guide for literature. Some students use <em>Chicago<\/em> as well. In September 2017, Chicago issued its seventeenth edition.<\/p>\n<p>The <em>AP Stylebook<\/em>, first published in 1953, is the bible for journalists. AP style focuses on saving space. Most web writing follows AP style.<\/p>\n<p>The print version of the <em>AP Stylebook<\/em> is published every other spring. The last version was published in 2020, and the next version will be published in 2022. The digital format is updated more often.<\/p>\n<p>In this post, you\u2019ll see how <em>Chicago<\/em> compares with the most recent updates to AP style.<\/p>\n<h1><strong>Guidelines versus rules<\/strong><\/h1>\n<p>It\u2019s important to note that these are style guides, not style rules. Consistency is the most important thing in any written piece. It\u2019s also important to be consistent across a website or company. But in some cases, it\u2019s appropriate to break a rule or use a less popular form, such as passive voice.<\/p>\n<p>As a professional writer, you need to understand when it\u2019s acceptable to break rules. Writing and editing aren\u2019t like accounting. Pedantry won\u2019t make you popular and may drive you crazy.<\/p>\n<p>First, you should follow the requirements of your boss or client, even if you don\u2019t always agree. It\u2019s also best to follow any guidelines that were created to avoid offending readers.<\/p>\n<p>You could never memorize a whole style guide, and you don\u2019t want to follow each guideline obsessively. But your reference books will help you write in a consistent and educated way.<\/p>\n<h1><strong>A word about web content<\/strong><\/h1>\n<p>Reading web content makes learning proper English more challenging. Both US and world English are used online, and they\u2019re different in terms of vocabulary, spelling, punctuation, and other aspects.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll also see a great deal of writing by speakers of English as a second language. If these writers don\u2019t seek editing by a native speaker of English, you\u2019ll see errors and often a wordier approach.<\/p>\n<p>Add to this the fact that many industries, companies, and brands use their own language. This includes not only jargon but also the \u201cbreaking\u201d of certain established grammar rules.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re a professional writer, you shouldn\u2019t necessarily rely on other writers for your English education. Despite good editing and proofreading efforts, even professionally written news stories and printed books feature errors. What reading can do is show you how to craft interesting sentences and organize your own work into a cohesive and engaging piece.<\/p>\n<p>So do familiarize yourself with the style guide that\u2019s appropriate for the type of writing you do. When in doubt, consult your guide instead of blindly following somebody else\u2019s writing.<\/p>\n<p>And now, the comparison.<\/p>\n<h1><strong>Punctuation<\/strong><\/h1>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>ITEM<\/strong><\/td>\n<td><strong>CMOS 17<\/strong><\/td>\n<td><strong>AP 2020 (updated 2021)<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Commas, general<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>(Note: Instructions on the comma are lengthy in both CMOS and AP.
