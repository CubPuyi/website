There was a time long, long ago, in a galaxy very like this one, when I didn&#8217;t know the difference either!<\/p>\n<p>In my defense, it is really easy to get confused. Generally speaking, you would use an apostrophe for omitted letters (e.g. when you say &#8220;what&#8217;s&#8221; instead of &#8220;what is&#8221;) as well as for <a href=\"https:\/\/wordcounter.net\/blog\/2016\/09\/02\/102276_what-are-plural-possessives.html\">possessives<\/a> (&#8220;John&#8217;s&#8221; meaning that something belongs to John). To make it even more confusing, you could say &#8220;John&#8217;s in the backyard,&#8221; and that would be an abbreviation of &#8220;John is.&#8221; Both the possessive form and the contraction get the apostrophe.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/wordcounter.net\/blog\/2016\/10\/26\/102560_can-you-start-a-sentence-with-but.html\">But<\/a> there is a special rule that applies to the word &#8220;it.&#8221; Sometimes, you&#8217;d use the apostrophe and that would be correct, and other times, it would be derisively referred to as a &#8220;grocers&#8217; apostrophe.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2>What&#8217;s a Grocer&#8217;s Apostrophe?<\/h2>\n<p>A grocers&#8217; apostrophe is an apostrophe that is used in the wrong place. Have you ever seen signage bearing the information &#8220;Banana&#8217;s on special today?&#8221; That&#8217;s a genuine grocer&#8217;s apostrophe in action. As you probably know, the plural of &#8220;banana&#8221; is &#8220;bananas.&#8221; No apostrophe is needed. You could say &#8220;The banana&#8217;s skin was yellow,&#8221; because you are now using the possessive form. The skin belonging to the banana was yellow.<\/p>\n<p>Just as you may feel a little superior when you see that &#8220;banana&#8217;s&#8221; are on special, so teachers and other nit-picky people like bosses and&#8230; well&#8230; me&#8230; would smirk when they see an &#8220;it&#8217;s&#8221; instead of an &#8220;its.&#8221; Let&#8217;s get into the nitty-gritty of which one to use in what circumstances. It&#8217;s actually quite logical. If you remember one important fact, you&#8217;ll never get it wrong again.<\/p>\n<h2>Only Use the Apostrophe for the Contraction<\/h2>\n<p>You only use the apostrophe for the contraction of &#8220;it is&#8221; and sometimes, &#8220;it has.&#8221; Can you remember this? Then you&#8217;re good to go already. In contractions, letters are omitted, and we indicate the missing letter with an apostrophe. Examples of contractions include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>It&#8217;s &#8211; It is<\/li>\n<li>What&#8217;s &#8211; What is<\/li>\n<li>Don&#8217;t &#8211; Do not<\/li>\n<li>Won&#8217;t &#8211; Will not<\/li>\n<li>She&#8217;ll &#8211; She will<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And so on, and so on. The apostrophe is used to show the word is a contraction, and in the case of the word &#8220;it,&#8221; it&#8217;s the only time you&#8217;ll use an apostrophe.<\/p>\n<h2>Never Use the Apostrophe For &#8220;Belonging to&#8221; It<\/h2>\n<p>Usually, you&#8217;d use the apostrophe for possessives too, but not in this case.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>John&#8217;s scarf got tangled in Mary&#8217;s.<\/li>\n<li>The children&#8217;s toys were all broken.<\/li>\n<li>The cat&#8217;s toy is under the sofa.<\/li>\n<li>The business&#8217; logo is very smart.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Use the word &#8220;it&#8221;, however, and the &#8220;belonging to&#8221; form has no apostrophe.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The cat played with its toy.<\/li>\n<li>Its paint is peeling.<\/li>\n<li>Its logo is unimaginative.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>How Can You Know for Sure When to Use the Apostrophe?<\/h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s easy! If you can extend &#8220;it&#8217;s&#8221; into &#8220;it is&#8221; or &#8220;it has,&#8221; then the apostrophe is completely correct. Try it with the possessive, and it obviously won&#8217;t work. Another way to remember is to think about the words &#8220;his&#8221; or &#8220;hers.&#8221; Neither of these words has an apostrophe either. &#8220;Its&#8221; is simply the form of &#8220;his&#8221; or &#8220;hers&#8221; you would use when talking about something that&#8217;s not a person.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s because the words &#8220;its,&#8221; &#8220;his&#8221; and &#8220;hers&#8221; are not actually nouns. They are <a href=\"https:\/\/wordcounter.net\/blog\/2016\/06\/15\/101738_what-is-a-pronoun.html\">pronouns<\/a>. That isn&#8217;t to say you would never use an apostrophe with a pronoun, but it does help a little since pronouns with apostrophes showing possession are relatively rare. Using them with possessive pronouns (and &#8220;its&#8221; is a possessive pronoun, just like &#8220;his,&#8221; &#8220;hers,&#8221; &#8220;yours,&#8221; or &#8220;theirs&#8221;) would be redundant because the very nature of the word shows possession.<\/p>\n<p>Now you have the more complicated explanation, too. But don&#8217;t worry about it too much. Simply remember when you refer to something belonging to an &#8220;it,&#8221; no apostrophe is used. Do that, and you&#8217;ll never make the <a href=\"https:\/\/wordcounter.net\/blog\/2016\/07\/25\/102009_common-writing-mistakes.html\">common writing mistake<\/a> of adding an apostrophe to &#8220;it&#8221; when it&#8217;s unnecessary.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Before you begin to feel bad about not knowing when to use &#8220;it&#8217;s&#8221; as opposed to &#8220;its,&#8221; I have a confession to make.
