However, <strong>a phrasal verb is formed by a phrase of more than one word<\/strong>. It is almost always made of <a href=\"https:\/\/wordcounter.net\/\">two words<\/a>: the verb and its particle, which often looks like a preposition but isn&#8217;t.<\/p>\n<h2>Particles Don&#8217;t Just Occur in Physics<\/h2>\n<p>For example, &#8220;count on&#8221; is phrasal, but &#8220;on&#8221; is not a preposition in this context. It&#8217;s a particle. Why? Because if I say, &#8220;I can count on you every day,&#8221; I am not saying that I use your body to do my counting &#8211; not unless we&#8217;re really close friends and like to do silly things together. So when &#8220;on&#8221; is paired with &#8220;count,&#8221; a new meaning is created. The phrasal verb is actually <a href=\"https:\/\/wordcounter.net\/blog\/2016\/06\/08\/101733_what-is-an-idiom.html\">an idiom<\/a>, a special way of expressing an idea that is not literal.<\/p>\n<p>The meaning of this sentence should be clear. I am stating that you are reliable and trustworthy, and every day I know what to expect from you. That&#8217;s what &#8220;count on&#8221; indicates.<\/p>\n<p>Another phrasal verb is &#8220;break up.&#8221; If you look at the literal meaning of the two parts, you might think it means to break an object into pieces. But when you use the words as a phrasal verb, you create a new meaning:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I broke up with my girlfriend after 10 years because she wanted to marry a rich guy.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Poor me &#8211; and yes, I really am poor because she preferred a man with lots of money. Can you see what I&#8217;m saying here? I ended my relationship; I &#8220;broke up&#8221; the boyfriend-girlfriend bond. This is a very common usage of &#8220;break up&#8221; (and it&#8217;s in the past tense because it already occurred). But it&#8217;s not the only meaning of this verb. See this example:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The students broke up when their teacher spilled milk all over his shiny new suit.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>What do you think they did? Did they rush to help him clean it off? Did they feel sad? No way: not those cruel students. They laughed! So here&#8217;s a second meaning of &#8220;break up.&#8221; It&#8217;s much less common than the first meaning, but you will see it, especially in American English. Since the two meanings are very different, it&#8217;s easy to tell which one is being used from the context it&#8217;s in. With a little experience, you can get used to phrasal verbs with multiple definitions.<\/p>\n<h2>Can You See the Phrasal Verb in This Sentence?<\/h2>\n<p>&#8220;I got away with looking in my textbook for answers while I took\u00a0the test.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Is it &#8220;got away&#8221;? Not quite. The phrasal verb is actually &#8220;got away with,&#8221; so it has three parts. Occasionally, you will see a phrasal such as this, but as stated above, they are generally two words. This is a great example of how to use &#8220;got away with,&#8221; because it means to do something (that&#8217;s not very good) without being caught or punished. At the same time, this is not a recommended action. I am clearly a lazy student who doesn&#8217;t want to study. I promise to improve. Here are two more sentences:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to run into him by accident at the concert.&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;Let&#8217;s shop around to see which computer gives us the best value.&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Did you see the phrasal verb in the first sentence? It is &#8220;run into.&#8221; It&#8217;s simple to identify it. However, the second sentence has three verbs: &#8220;shop,&#8221; &#8220;to see&#8221; and &#8220;gives.&#8221; Where&#8217;s the phrasal one? It must be &#8220;shop around.&#8221; It&#8217;s the only one with a particle. &#8220;To see&#8221; is an infinitive. If you reverse it and write &#8220;see to,&#8221; you have another phrasal verb. So to identify a phrasal verb, always look for the verb first and the particle second (and third, in some cases).<\/p>\n<h2>A List of Common Phrasal Verbs<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Bring up<\/li>\n<li>Bring on<\/li>\n<li>Call on<\/li>\n<li>Call off<\/li>\n<li>Cheer on<\/li>\n<li>Cheer up<\/li>\n<li>Come up<\/li>\n<li>Come in<\/li>\n<li>Cut off<\/li>\n<li>Cut (something) out<\/li>\n<li>Cut in<\/li>\n<li>Drop by\/in<\/li>\n<li>Drop off<\/li>\n<li>Fall apart<\/li>\n<li>Fill (someone) in<\/li>\n<li>Get away<\/li>\n<li>Get along with<\/li>\n<li>Get up<\/li>\n<li>Get back to<\/li>\n<li>Get back at<\/li>\n<li>Give out<\/li>\n<li>Give in<\/li>\n<li>Give away<\/li>\n<li>Give up<\/li>\n<li>Go out with<\/li>\n<li>Go ahead<\/li>\n<li>Grow up<\/li>\n<li>Grow apart<\/li>\n<li>Hang on<\/li>\n<li>Hang out<\/li>\n<li>Hang up<\/li>\n<li>Hold on<\/li>\n<li>Hold back<\/li>\n<li>Log in (to)<\/li>\n<li>Log out<\/li>\n<li>Look up<\/li>\n<li>Look out<\/li>\n<li>Pay back<\/li>\n<li>Pay for<\/li>\n<li>Put out<\/li>\n<li>Put on<\/li>\n<li>Take off<\/li>\n<li>Take out<\/li>\n<li>Turn on<\/li>\n<li>Turn off<\/li>\n<li>Turn around<\/li>\n<li>Turn up<\/li>\n<li>Work out<\/li>\n<li>Work (something) out<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A normal verb is just one word: go, see, eat or cry.
