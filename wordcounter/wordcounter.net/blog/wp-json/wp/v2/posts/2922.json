Instead, we&#8217;re talking about words that give you a feeling of real disgust. They&#8217;re perfectly ordinary, otherwise-innocuous-seeming words, but researchers have found when study participants are asked to rate words based on their gut-reaction, these words are consistently rated as being the most hated ones.<\/p>\n<h2>A Lot of People Hate the Word &#8220;Moist&#8221;<\/h2>\n<p>Paul Thibodeau, a psychology professor, <a href=\"http:\/\/thepsychreport.com\/science\/moist-conundrum\/\">authored a study<\/a> based on the way 2,500 people reacted to words, and &#8220;moist&#8221; was generally considered to be downright nasty. It&#8217;s possible the reaction would have been different if he included it in a phrase like &#8220;moist chocolate cake,&#8221; but when viewed on its own, it was seen as being absolutely disgusting by 25 percent of the group.<\/p>\n<p>Words using similar sounds didn&#8217;t get the thumbs down. People felt relatively neutral about &#8220;hoist,&#8221; for example. So, what&#8217;s the problem with &#8220;moist?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Professor Thibodeau thinks it may be the association between &#8220;moist&#8221; and bodily functions. &#8220;Vomit&#8221; and &#8220;phlegm&#8221; were also rated as being among the most-hated, so he joined the dots and decided that words related to bodily fluids were the pits.<\/p>\n<h2>A Linguistics Professor and a Neurologist Blame Sounds<\/h2>\n<p>Professor Jason Riggle and Dr. David Eagleman, a neuroscientist, think that word aversion comes from the sounds themselves. Just as we feel odd after hearing a jarring sound in music, certain word-sounds are unpleasant to us. Dr. Eagleman has done his own experiments using made-up words and found that people didn&#8217;t like unusual sound combinations. So, if we think a word sounds funny, we&#8217;re more likely to associate it with something unpleasant.<\/p>\n<h2>Associations or Sounds: Who Is Right?<\/h2>\n<p>I&#8217;m going to sit on the fence with this one. Associations really can make a word disgusting. Take &#8220;vomit&#8221; for example. The very thought of vomiting is stomach-churning. The word itself is probably innocent enough, but the association is utterly gross!<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, I can believe that sounds that don&#8217;t fit our ideas of harmony would also be jarring. Unlike Dr. Eagleman, I&#8217;ve never invented a truly disgusting word, and I wouldn&#8217;t know where to begin, but it makes sense in a way.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d say both reasons for being disgusted by words are valid. What do you think?<\/p>\n<h2>Is This Useful Knowledge?<\/h2>\n<p>Oddly enough, I think this knowledge could be useful, particularly in the marketing world. When we send out marketing messages, we need to be very <a href=\"https:\/\/wordcounter.net\/blog\/2014\/01\/22\/1027_25-ways-to-improve-your-writing-vocabulary.html\">careful in our word choices<\/a>. We might even want to disgust our audience before offering them a calming, soothing message that explains how to solve a problem. Alternatively, we might want to avoid any negative associations whatsoever.<\/p>\n<p>Still, just because of chocolate cake, I&#8217;m not altogether convinced about the gut-churning effects of the word &#8220;moist.&#8221; Couple it with cake, and suddenly, it sounds very, very yummy. Is it just me who thinks so? Of course, being covered with moist sweat sounds a whole lot less delicious, so I think we need to add context before we can talk about word aversion.<\/p>\n<p>Made-up words are two-a-penny. Just look at company names and brand names, and you&#8217;re sure to find at least a few invented words. If we could know what sounds or combinations of sounds give people that &#8220;Eeeyew!&#8221; feeling of disgust, and which ones make them feel great, it could surely help companies with their branding strategies.<\/p>\n<h2>Is It OK to Hate Words?<\/h2>\n<p>I&#8217;ve read commentary about how silly it is to hate words, but whether it&#8217;s silly or not, it seems to be a real enough phenomenon. But to play devil&#8217;s advocate, we need negative words as much as we need positive ones. After all, if you want to describe something gross, having some unpleasant-sounding words or ones with less-than-charming associations, is mighty handy!<\/p>\n<p>I use &#8220;vomit&#8221; quite often, &#8220;I went into the exam room, vomited out a whole lot of information, and scored an A!&#8221; The word &#8220;regurgitated&#8221; is interchangeable here, or you could use it to indicate your disgust, &#8220;He just regurgitated the same old information we always hear on that subject!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Of course, some people react more strongly to word aversion than others do, and I put it down to sensitivity or possibly a very active imagination. Neither of these things is bad to have, although they might make your life a little more interesting than it needs to be.<\/p>\n<h2>What Words Do You Hate and Why?<\/h2>\n<p>First, a few ground-rules. We&#8217;ll just assume that anything obscene or scatological is gross, so those words are out of bounds. Some words are annoying, but that&#8217;s because of the way people use them and abuse them, so we&#8217;ll overlook them too. What we want, is a list of words that make you feel slightly queasy just looking at them.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s my two cents&#8217; worth:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/wordcounter.net\/blog\/2016\/07\/27\/102029_why-should-i-blog.html\">Blog<\/a><\/strong>. I don&#8217;t know why I hate it so much. I think it&#8217;s the sound of the word. And looking around the web, I see that others agree with me.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Mucus<\/strong>. This seems to confirm the theory that bodily fluids disgust us. But somehow, even &#8220;snot&#8221; is better than &#8220;mucus,&#8221; so maybe it&#8217;s a combination of sound and association.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Pustule<\/strong>. Yuk! I can&#8217;t think of a good thing to say about this word. Nothing about it is nice!<\/li>\n<li><strong>Maggot<\/strong>. The word itself may not be to blame, but the associations are there!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To be honest, I don&#8217;t think there are any words that I hate in the truest sense of the word, but these would certainly top my list of the words I don&#8217;t like all that much.<\/p>\n<h2>Top Words People Hate<\/h2>\n<p>For those looking for a top list of words people hate, here are some words to consider:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Blog<\/li>\n<li>Bulbous<\/li>\n<li>Chunky<\/li>\n<li>Clogged<\/li>\n<li>Curd<\/li>\n<li>Dripping<\/li>\n<li>Fester<\/li>\n<li>Fetus<\/li>\n<li>Gurgle<\/li>\n<li>Jowls<\/li>\n<li>Lugubrious<\/li>\n<li>Maggots<\/li>\n<li>Moist<\/li>\n<li>Mucus<\/li>\n<li>Munch<\/li>\n<li>Orifice<\/li>\n<li>Panties<\/li>\n<li>Phlegm<\/li>\n<li>Pustule<\/li>\n<li>Queasy<\/li>\n<li>Roaches<\/li>\n<li>Secrete<\/li>\n<li>Slacks<\/li>\n<li>Slurp<\/li>\n<li>Smear<\/li>\n<li>Squirt<\/li>\n<li>Viscous<\/li>\n<li>Vomit<\/li>\n<li>Yolk<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Are there words that you simply hate?
