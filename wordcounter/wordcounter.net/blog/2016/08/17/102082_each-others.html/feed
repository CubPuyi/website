					<description><![CDATA[Ha  ha ....no need for pay pal here but thank you for a very clear explanation! English is my second and current language but has never been by choice! I have been corrected many times for using &quot;Each others&quot; or Each Other&#039;s&quot;. Both sounds the same to me and I &#039;kind&#039; of thought that this meant some sort of &#039;reflective ownership&#039;. I&#039;m not sure what prompted me to think that way. 
So here we are, it is ALWAYS SINGULAR! To get it even more bizarre my  native language does not pronounce the Ss after pluralised words so I often fail to sound them in English and have to make a constant effort to remember to do so. But &#039;each otherZ&#039; is an unfortunate exception to this! 
Well, three cheers to each  other&#039;s comprehension to improve our communication in the future!
PS: I thought I had finished with this, but started to read some of the comments below... I&#039;m amazed how people seemingly, from the same native language, seem to be divided among &#039;each other&#039;. And how &#039;correct English&#039; seems to be the privilege of the the &#039;learned ones&#039;. 
For fun I&#039;m learning Spanish and I often see some contradictions from native Spanish speaking people. And this reminds me when I started to learn English in Sydney Australia, at night college, where only 3 of us were foreigners. The teacher pointed out to the class that it was improper to say things like &quot;I would of&quot;, amongst others such erroneous citations...
As for me, I love to write but I have always been quite &#039;disrespectful&#039; of grammar and spelling, again not by choice, but, simply, because I could not do better regardless of any of the 3 languages I indulge with.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[But imagine you are talking about a group of six people, all of whom live in the pockets of each other (metaphorically speaking). The form “each other’s pockets” would clearly be wrong in this case. You can see that by the fact that pockets is plural (imagine each person in the group has only one pocket). Because each person in the group is living in multiple pockets belonging to multiple people, the apostrophe should come after plural “others”. It helps if you remind yourself that “every” is a synonym of “each”. “Each” does not automatically imply a singular.]]></description>

It depends on who you are addressing to. I thought &quot;each others&#039;&quot; seemed right, as well, but that isn&#039;t the case. Just remember: If each is plural, it is each others&#039;, but if it is not (singular), it is talking about one person, so it would be this: &quot;each other&quot;. Also, &quot;each others&#039;&quot; doesn&#039;t necessarily exist. A better way to compare the two differences is by checking out Google Images. They help a lot, and are better for this.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I accept that this is probably the correct way of writing it, but it frustrates me because &quot;each others&#039;&quot; seems so right. I tend to think of &quot;each other&quot; as a singular word indicating two or more people in relation to each other. So it feels like I should treat it the same as other non-S-ending plurals. Say... &quot;sheep&quot;. &quot;One sheep&quot; vs &quot;two sheep&quot;. &quot;The (one) sheep&#039;s wool&quot; vs &quot;the (two) sheeps&#039; wool&quot;. Honestly I&#039;m not sure that&#039;s grammatically correct but I can think of no other way to indicate possessive plural. 
What is &quot;each other&quot; anyway? A noun? It must be, to be able to possess. It&#039;s a strange one though, as i can&#039;t think of any instance in which it might be able to... do an action. Otherwise, i would say that &quot;each other&#039;s&quot; should be reserved for its &quot;is&quot; contraction. Or if it&#039;s plural then I guess it&#039;d have an &quot;are&quot; instead. Hmm. 
Truly a strange word. Even so, I feel like confusing &quot;each other&#039;s&quot; and &quot;each others&#039;&quot; is easily one of the least offensive grammar mistakes. But thanks for the explanation. I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll remember it whether I want to or not.]]></description>
