Danes are absolutely not North Germans.  We are Scandinavian like Norwegians and Swedes.  Our languages are similar and very different from German.  We have much more in common with the Dutch, e.g. we are both seafaring nations, we are much more informal.]]></description>

Well, I’m a born American with German, Irish ancestry. I LOVE learning about Europe!  I’ve been to Spain, England, Italy, Germany, and Portugal, and Peru (not Europe, I know)  I will plan my next trip to Denmark, and Netherlands. So just know that not ‘all’ Americans are “America-centric.”]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Very nicely written article. Though I knew the difference between Dutch and Danish, your article brought about a little piece of history, which I didn&#039;t know.

Thank you.]]></description>

Denmarks gdp per capita is higher than the Netherlands. Cultaral heritage - give me a break - I just say Vikings. Football - I agree, but currently Denmark is ranked 10 and Netherland 16.
I would say that Denmark is one of the most developed countries in the world with very high standard and quality of life - just watch every rankings about that.]]></description>

I&#039;d say the Dutch are a bit taller, they do speak a bit better English, they are more about bikes and windmills. They are also more developed whether it&#039;s economical or intrernational way; they are in a possession of much stronger cultural heritage.  And... And they are stronger in football !   ))]]></description>
