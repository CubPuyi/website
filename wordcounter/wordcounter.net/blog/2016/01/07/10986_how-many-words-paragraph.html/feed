					<description><![CDATA[I am a bit concerned that the single and pervasive focus on readability, which is ease of reading by simplicity of language and brevity of text, has the cumulative effect of reducing an individual&#039;s reading comprehension and diminishing their overall capacity for handling texts of even moderate complexity. The mind is not a static instrument; it is continually changing in response to the challenges, of lack of challenges presented to it by one&#039;s habitual environment. When virtually all written text which a person is likely to encounter on a daily basis has been tailored to be simple and easy to read and comprehend, the mind is on a downward trajectory of diminishing capacity. I would guess that the majority of texts which a person reads day-to-day are either above or below their own level, and fewer texts match the reader&#039;s level exactly. The mantra of readability ensures that a non-academic reader is practically guaranteed to be reading consistently below their level. No doubt,  our fluid and efficient minds will accommodate the lessened challenge and effort with reduced capacity.]]></description>

I know this was posted four years ago now, but I felt like saying something to this comment. 
     I&#039;m going to quote the famous Obi-wan from Star Wars 2: &quot;You need to go home and rethink YOUR life&quot;. I think that your comment is a little too extreme- there are many good people in this world who care about doing your best in everything- even the seeming insignificant things. For example, how many words are in a paragraph. If you&#039;re looking to argue against something in such a strongly negative way, why don&#039;t you please kindly do it against something that is actually worth speaking out against? Is it worth saying something rude and insulting just for fun? Obviously, to you it might be, but I&#039;m sure many people would agree with me that it isn&#039;t.]]></description>
