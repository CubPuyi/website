Who says we&#039;re not real here? and who says the discussion on the font is at the top one? Yes, the font is not something that should not be of much concern compared to the actual proposal. But we are here to study, discuss, and do further research about it how to spice up a certain proposal. You may be on the wrong page of the discussion.]]></description>

I am pretty sure the topic mainly focused on the Project Proposal font. You may be looking for the topic of &quot;business plan content&quot; and the like.

Font, style, colors, and even graphical representations of every are now being looked into as some factors of credibility, professionalism (scientific research)]]></description>

I might agree on the point, however in my experience many people is concerned about the fact that readers are too busy to actually read the whole document so they feel the need to make it more &#039;easy&#039; for the reader with fancy design]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A good way to tell if fonts are important is to look and see what the best in industry does. Google, Apple, Samsung, and even ExxonMobil all have their own custom typefaces, which took considerable time, effort, and expense. 

If a little time picking one that&#039;s already available can make a difference, why not? Or find a professional one for sale. You don&#039;t have to research a new font for every proposal. 

Also, on a more practical level, Times New Roman does not OCR very well. This could impact customer experience. That&#039;s one reason I&#039;m spending time finding a good one for contracts.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[it&#039;s all about the 1% ers...we assume your document..no matter what type style is written about your high quality service or product. Font size and style is important. Think about trying to make it hard for people to read to prove the point.  Write Language from Alan Pease is a good one. Likewise for those of us that sell, just google David Ogilvy and see not only font and size but layout. If the thread is on proposals, then evidence is key...and David researched where eyeballs go and what makes it easier to read. Not considering these points means you are perfect and we look forward to buying your book.]]></description>
