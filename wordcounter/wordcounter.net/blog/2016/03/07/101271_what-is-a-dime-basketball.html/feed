					<description><![CDATA[Funny . O have been following the nba all my frickin life and this is the first I heard of an assist being called a dime. Just another example of people claiming they want equality but contradicting it by the separatist display of getting there own way. Go figure. Rock on.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m an old point guard.  It was always explained to me that a certain kind of assist was called &quot;a dime.&quot;  That was an assist, often in a backdoor play, where the guard passed into and through traffic to the scorer.  Coach said it was a &quot;dime.&quot;  He meant that the only way to get the ball through to the scorer, through traffic, was to make the ball as thin as a dime.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;To drop a dime on&quot;, as mentioned, means to inform on. Supposedly originating, as also mentioned, because it would likely be via an anonymous call from a pay phone which cost a dime for many years.

The phrase can be heard in the Amazon LA detective series Bosch, season 5 (2019), episode 10, at 1:59. &quot;Do you think Galligan will drop a dime on you?&quot;]]></description>

Nobody said that the term was used with basketball in the 1960s. They said that back then it referred to assisting with a pay phone, which over time turned into assisting someone in general, and that nowadays it means a basketball assist.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I find it interesting that there are so many explanations offered, but none of them give actual credit to where not only the term derives, but more importantly, by whom. Let&#039;s be honest, the NBA as well, as NFL are and always have been greatly influenced by culture, and you can&#039;t talk about culture without acknowledging it&#039;s diversity, and racial influences. As with most of the cool colloquial terms and trends used in America it came from the black community. It&#039;s likely that the term, which is also used in the NFL to describe a pin-point accurate, pass, seemingly &quot;dropped&quot; into the receiver&#039;s outstretched arms or &quot;pocket&quot;, came from some version of dropping dimes into hats, or the value of what was being dropped. Whether either is true is less important than &quot;why&quot;. The reason is found in the activity itself. You&#039;re offering help...assistance, which we all as humans regardless of culture, can relate to. And in all cultures, there is some gesture or phrase that exists to show thanks for the kindful act. In the NBA&#039;s case, it&#039;s acknowledging the guy who &quot;could probably score if he wanted to&quot;, or he intentionally &quot;created an opportunity for another guy to score&quot;. In every instance, the act of &quot;acknowledging&#039; these moments and acting on them consistently is one of the games most notable and praised player attributes because it takes great vision, skill and intelligence to be an effective passer. So much so, that most players attributed to being great passers, are usually the leader of the team. Magic Johnson wasn&#039;t considered the best ball handler in NBA history, but his passing skill and vision were off the charts. Guys used to say that he&#039;d consistently hit people with the ball who weren&#039;t expecting a pass. Le Bron James and other &quot;big men&quot; are constantly referred to by their passing ability, and this is a metric of analysis that can distinguish one player to be better over another. Not only because of the selflessness of the act itself, but because passing is difficult...the men are large and athletic, the game is fast...which makes the windows by and through which a pass is possible, very small and infrequent. So, let&#039;s continue the great debate of where the word came from, but we&#039;d be remiss for not acknowledging the &quot;who&quot; or the &quot;why&quot; we use the term to begin with.]]></description>
