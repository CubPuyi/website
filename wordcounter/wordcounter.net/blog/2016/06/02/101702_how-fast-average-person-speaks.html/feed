This response is many years later than the comment but remains true. Many languages do sound fast but in fact, all languages take about the same length of time to convey the same message. Yes, German written language is usually more &#039;text dense&#039; on the page but comes out in the same amount of time as it would in English, Chinese, etc. However, for clutter, Tagalog from the Philippines is the hardest for me to &#039;hear&#039;.]]></description>

I taught Sunday School to kids, half of whom were bilingual in Spanish. I did an experiment with them once, and yes, the *do* speak faster in Spanish than in English. When I told them the results, they told me that they already knew that.
But why is it so?  
With the trilling of &quot;r&quot;s and other Spanish sounds that seem to take more work to pronounce, not to mention that more complex conjugation of verbs, it would seem to me that the opposite ought to be true.
English is my second language.  However, when I visited Budapest as a middle-aged adult, I thought that it seemed that Hungarians talked faster because my proficiency in my &quot;mother tongue&quot; is only at a grade school level.  And Hungarian conjugation is *crazy*, plus it has sounds that no native American speaker can handle. I don&#039;t have problems with it; a Budapest police officer was surprised to discover (when I handed her my passport) that I was an American citizen; she couldn&#039;t tell from my accent, and congratulated me as she handed me my traffic ticket :-( . Time to do another experiment...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Arrived here looking for a for a &quot;word counting&quot; system.  A device that will tell you how many words you have spoken in a period of time.  It says 100+ a minute,. 7-20 thousand daily.  A WORD document will tell you how many written words are in your publication.  Sheet music will tell you how many musical notes.  A time piece the seconds, minutes, hours, days, etc. A ruler lengths.  A calculator numbers. ETC.  BUT, how many words did your brain, larynx, tongue, lips, send via Vibrational Energy into the Earthly/Universal plasma of reality Yesterday?  Who else is interested? If there is no device to do so, can one be invented?  Who has the &quot;biggest mouth?&quot;. Do you ever shut up?  Can I get a minute of silence.  What do you do in a public library, when you are required to be silent?  How about a Movie Theater?  When you are alone?  If you move your jaw too much, you get those lines from your lips to your jaw! Will you give my ears wrestling? SO how many words did I just type?  I am a professional author, so Words are my income.]]></description>

I think this will depend on how stressed or nervous someone is. If you are calm it is easy to speak at a slow and understandable speed but the moment you add stress it can become almost impossible to understand someone.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have worked in call centers before and the speed of speaking is something that they train you on. If you talk too fast, then you can confuse and overwhelm people, but if you speak too slowly, then you can lose their attention and their patience. I tend to be a really quick speaker so this was difficult for me to learn at first, especially since I was so nervous about speaking to strangers. lol]]></description>
