I think you should reread the article as it explains it rather well. Not only does it tell you what I pronoun is, it tells you the different types of pronouns that exist.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[And I only knew about half the pronouns and their categories.

Did a long course on pronouns in February - March 2003.

Grammar keeps moving; changing and being dynamic.

Harriet - nearly every sentence has a pronoun. Think of them taking the place of something else.

Delma: glad you&#039;re writing a paper. I, me and mine are personal pronouns.

In other languages pronouns determine conjugations. Some come at the end of words [verbs] like the Polish aspect.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What? I don&#039;t understand this at all. Can someone explain it to me so that it makes more sense. How can I tell if there is a pronoun in a sentence? I need to learn this for a test but I will be taking in another week. Please help!]]></description>
