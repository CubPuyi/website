					<description><![CDATA[This may considered as off the beaten path but my bro and I used to love playing what I called The Name Game. We&#039;d take turns choosing a letter. If P is chosen we write down every name we can think of starting w/P. We started w/female names. When we couldn&#039;t think of anymore I&#039;d ask how many he had, he asked how many I had. if we were satisfied with our count it was pencils down. If we thought we could squeeze out more we continued. Once we decided we were done, the one w/the lesser amt went 1st and read his list.If we thought it was a made up name we&#039;d challenge it. If he could convince me it was legit it stayed.Then it was my turn to do the same, reading my list of names. When we were done and a winner was declared we did the same thing w/male names.A word game I like doing solo is choosing a word and seeing how many words I can make from the letters in the word I chose. Words like market,  restaurant, illegal, etc. Well that&#039;s it for me.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi - I see that Balderdash is on this list. You may also be interested in an online game called Dixonary. Itâ€™s a version of games like Balderdash and Dictionary, where an obscure word is posted and players make up fake definitions and then try to vote for the real one. Weâ€™ve been playing for more than 25 years, making it the oldest continuously played online game. Weâ€™re now looking for new players. Itâ€™s fun, addictive, and takes very little time.
Hereâ€™s an example. Without looking it up (as itâ€™s a game of trust), whatâ€™s the meaning of oxygal? 
1.	Having sharp or pointed edges
2.	A rudimentary shelter
3.	Sour milk
4.	Of or relating to marsupials

Oxygal answer: If you picked 3, you would be correct, but if you picked 1, you have joined the bulk of the players who also voted for this (and made the player who wrote this definition the winner).]]></description>
