					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for the clear explanation! A common mistake I used to make was using a semicolon before a list, not in it. It felt less bold than a colon; when I was unsure, bold seemed risky.  To those making slurs and speaking about using punctuation as pretentious, I am sorry you feel that people who can google the correct way to use a semicolon are better than you. Remember this, it just isn&#039;t true, yes they can wield a sentence better than you can, but that doesn&#039;t make them a better person than you. Also, if you are feeling inferior, practice makes perfect, and you have great writing blogs like this to help, so you don&#039;t have to feel alone either.]]></description>

You just used &quot;however, as a young girl...&quot; in the first sentence, when that was the perfect opportunity to use the semi colon... . 
For example, &quot;I do not have extensive college training; however, as a young girl growing up with my parents and siblings in the Caribbean (where my mother was a book-worm and my father a stickler for the so-called ‘Queens English’ ), not only did I practice speaking proper English consistently, but read and wrote a whole lot.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Strange. I would never consider this usage pretentious at all:

&quot;The council is John Smith, president; Alison Peterson, vice president; Bruce Jeffries, secretary; and Marilyn Ehrmantraut, treasurer.&quot;

In my opinion, without using semicolons there, it can get confusing. I don&#039;t find that pretentious (or too much effort) at all.]]></description>

OK, but judgemental should not be written with a hyphen. Just a comment deriving from the &#039;Queen&#039;s English&#039; perspective.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I appreciate this information on the proper use of the colon and semi-colon. I am in college and I think the idea of believing someone using a semi-colon means they think they&#039;re superior is absolutely ridiculous! It is this type of judgmental thinking that has taken this world to the hate filled place that it is. 
I agree with Lana. I use the semi-colon so I don&#039;t feel I have over used commas or have choppy sentences. Now that I know using them makes me a &quot;pretentious writer&quot; and &quot;shows I&#039;ve been to college&quot; I think I&#039;ll use them more.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I  beg to differ.  I do not have extensive college training, however as a young girl growing up with my parents and siblings, in the Caribbean, where my mother was a book-worm, and my father a stickler for the so-called &#039;Queens English&#039;  I not only practiced speaking proper English consistently, but read and wrote a whole lot. 
In school up to 1974, we had to use punctuation marks.  Use of a  semi-colon was never viewed as a mark of intelligence or level of education. 
 So that when I write a lot of reports and other documents particularly at work, I feel the need to link sentences, in places where it may appear that there is over-use of the coma, or awkward for a full-stop/period. 
I find it really necessary, and I never had the slightest feeling that I would be impressing anyone with the use of a semi-colon.  We cannot assume that we interpret the actions of everyone accurately; that could be being judge-mental.   Believe I used it appropriately  here. I could have utilized it earlier also I think.  Notice how easily I write a lot?]]></description>

I agree. Only those who think they are superior try to use punctuation like this. it&#039;s easier for most of us to avoid it. There are usually better ways to write the same thing without using a colon or a semi-colon.]]></description>
