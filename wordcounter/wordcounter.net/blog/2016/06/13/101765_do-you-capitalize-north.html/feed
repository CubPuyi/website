					<description><![CDATA[Would T/true N/north be considered a proper noun or not? A sentence mentioning true north, uncapitalized, doesn&#039;t look right to me. TIA!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As the origin of &quot;Go West, young man...&quot; is much debated (Greeley? Soule? Other? Neither?) and, as such, not truly quotable verbatim, is &quot;west&quot; to be capitalized if the phrase is taken simply at face value? Thanks!]]></description>

This is why you never want to rely exclusively on spell checkers and grammar checkers. They have a difficult time distinguishing between directions and proper nouns with north, south, east, and west. It&#039;s best to always double check knowing the correct rule.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[North, South, East, West or north, south, east, west. It seems so simple once you understand when to capitalize and when not to, but it isn&#039;t obvious in my opinion. I won&#039;t make this mistake any more.]]></description>

I found this post because I wasn&#039;t sure of the answer to the question. Directions always gave me trouble and I sometimes would capitalize, but not other times. I&#039;m glad I know now. You certainly learn something new every day.]]></description>
