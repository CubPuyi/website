This is the best answer here. Counting footnotes is actually counterproductive when given an assignment with a min or max. They aren&#039;t a part of the actually assignment. They are an added addition in case you didn&#039;t know something or needed more clarification.]]></description>

Neither adds anything to the topic you&#039;re writing about (just give information about where you got a certain statement of idea), so it doesn&#039;t add to the essay in a informational way. Therefore, they should not be counted.]]></description>

Or you need to look at the writing from different perspectives rather than from a single one. When students aren&#039;t able to reach word count, it&#039;s usually because they see the question to be answered as one-dimensional instead of from a variety of different perspectives from my experience.]]></description>

Isn&#039;t that what the articles just said? If your professor says footnotes and endnotes count, then you should count them. If she says they don&#039;t, then you shouldn&#039;t. If she doesn&#039;t say anything, then assume they don&#039;t count and ask to clarify if you have the opportunity.]]></description>

Any professor who would require that footnotes or endnotes count as part of the word count just sounds like a lazy professor who doesn&#039;t want to read the full amount that they are assigning.]]></description>

No. If you aren&#039;t given any guidance as to whether or not you can use footnotes as part of your word count, you should assume that they are NOT counted. That&#039;s the rule in most cases, so you should opt with what is most prevalent. The only time you should count footnotes as part of word count is it the teacher specifically says that it&#039;s okay to do so.]]></description>

Although footnotes do have words written within them, they unfortunately do not count at all because they aren&#039;t part of the actual essay writing. This may seem bad but it is how it works unless specified otherwise. If they counted, all everyone would do is footnote every sentence to up the word count!]]></description>
