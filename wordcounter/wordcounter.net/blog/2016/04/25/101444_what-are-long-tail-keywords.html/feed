					<description><![CDATA[Beautiful post. Long tail keywords are an area most people fail to optimize as much as they should for their websites. It can be a great way to drive traffic. There’s certainly a lot of information out there to research about this subject.

This is a huge myth that too many bloggers believe. it simply isn&#039;t true. They do matter, and they matter a lot. It doesn&#039;t matter how great of a writer you are, if nobody can find the content, nobody is going to read it. The best way for new bloggers to get some traffic is by utilizing long-tail keywords where there is less SEO competition. Those who don&#039;t are going to have few pageviews to their blogs.]]></description>

Although you do not need to use keywords if you blog about what you love, it is always a great idea to do so as this will improve traffic to your site. I&#039;m sure that is what you want, I mean why write posts if you do not get people to read it? Great posts are never great for the people that don&#039;t read them.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Do people really search that specifically when using search engines. I like the concept of longtail keywords, but most people don&#039;t get that specific in my opinion. That means you are only getting a few searches from them whihc isn&#039;t worth the effort. Better to go for the high traffic words if you want to make money.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This article has me believing I&#039;ve been blogging all wrong for the last 6 months. I have been trying to do well with short tail keywords, but my blog is so small that it&#039;s difficult to compete with the big media. This makes a lot more sense on how to approach it. Maybe I&#039;ll even start getting some traffic. Thanks again.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is great! Long tail keywords help make sure that you are finding exactly what you are searching for and also that if you have a website, you don&#039;t fall into obscurity. I don&#039;t think everyone knows how Google works, but they are not always fair with their search results, so a lot of new websites are hard for people to find.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think people should worry too much about keywords or long tail keywords. If you write good content, you will get to the top of search engines. People worry too much about seo instead of writing quality content. If you want to have a successful blog or a successful website, you have to have quality content, not content written for seo. Stop worrying about that stuff and just write great stuff.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So, is what you&#039;re saying is that I should be picking a long string of words instead of us short string of words to concentrate on? How do you go about and find those longtail keywords? Is there some special way to know which groups of words and phrases will rank better than others? I want to have a lot more traffic to my blog, because right now there aren&#039;t that many people that are coming to it. I want to figure out a way to bring many more people to it. This sounds like a good idea, but I don&#039;t understand how I&#039;m supposed to choose the right words so that a lot more people come. Please help me.]]></description>
