					<description><![CDATA[Certainly, there is a lot less &quot;work&quot; required to produce a low content or no content book compared with a technical work or a fiction story but I definitely put a lot of work into the ones I produce, simply because I want my books to be different from all the other ones available. Having said that, I really enjoy creating adult coloring, kids puzzle and journals / workbooks. It&#039;s not like work at all, when you are enjoying yourself. And so speaks someone who has wanted to be an author since she was 8 years old, which was a VERY long time ago. Now I have a shelf full of books with my name on the cover.]]></description>

If I am drawing images from my imagination, making sure they have aesthetically pleasing composition and content, cleaning them up, getting a high res scan, cleaning that up, making sure it is all clear and colorable at the appropriate page size, making sure the paper is appropriate for the coloring medium, then arranging the images in a pleasing collection ... I&#039;m going to call it a book.  It&#039;s just as much thought and effort and just as valid as words on a page.]]></description>

Whether you think it&#039;s a legitimate career or not, they sell. I publish these and I make real actual money. I have a hundreds of different themed journals and I get sales every single day. I&#039;ve also published novels and short stories, but the low/no content books sell so much better. Why do all the work of actually writing everything? Customers like to write too. I have workbooks, activity books, game books (all customized so the innards of them are unique thanks to Adobe data merge).  So if it&#039;s not your thing, then move along but don&#039;t condemn the folks who produce these books because we have kids to feed and that&#039;s just plain rude.]]></description>

This market has been saturated. Anyone trying to get int adult coloring books at this time will fail because everyone has already heard and tried to make money with them. In order to make money with no or low content books, you need to stay ahead of the curve and find a new niche before the hoards descend upon it. It&#039;s not easy, but that&#039;s where the money is. Following everyone else will leave you penniless.]]></description>

What type of no content books have you been writing? If you haven&#039;t made much money creating them so far, what makes you think that there&#039;s the potential to make a lot of money with them in the future? I&#039;m not trying to be too nosy here, but I&#039;m interested to see if this might be something that I would like to try. I&#039;m just looking for some advice since this seems to be an honest answer about making money with no content books.]]></description>
