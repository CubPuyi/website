You are completely wrong. Right and wrong have nothing to do with being persuasive. In fact, being able to be persuasive on a topic you don&#039;t believe in is a great way to measure how good you are at this skill.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Persuasive writing definitely comes in handy in so many applications throughout our lives. When they first taught us this in school, I thought, &quot;Why would I need this? What would I be trying to convince people of?&quot; Well, it turns out that I have used this many times in my life. Writing petitions, trying to flip someone&#039;s decision in regards to a job, a decision for benefits, etc. It can make a huge impact on your life.]]></description>

This is so true. If you can understand and articulate the opposing opinion to your argument, you are in a much better position to be persuasive. Too many people believe that people will just agree with them because that&#039;s the way they think. When you get to the point where you can understand the reasoning behind opinions you don&#039;t necessarily agree with, you&#039;re in a position to argue and persuade from a much stronger position. Even better, it may open your mind and get you to reflect on things in a different way than you had been in the past.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I, too, believe everybody should learn to write the fundamentals of the persuasive essay. Learning how to be persuasive is really a talent that may greatly improve your potential earnings during your lifetime. It may seem contrite to say this, but if you can persuade people, you are in the position to make a lot of money. That&#039;s why good salespeople make so much. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One of the best ways to be persuasive is to understand the opposing opinion&#039;s arguments. If you can argue the opinion opposite your own with clarity and understanding, then you can argue yours as well. Too many people dismiss the other side&#039;s arguments instead of trying to understand them. When you can argue both sides is when you truly become persuasive.]]></description>
