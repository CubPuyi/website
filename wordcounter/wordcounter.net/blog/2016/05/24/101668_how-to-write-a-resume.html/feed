This can&#039;t be stressed enough. Proofread your resume! Obvious spelling and grammatical mistakes will get your resume instantly thrown into the trash. if you can&#039;t take the time to get your resume right when you have a lot of time, why should the company think you&#039;ll do a good job under the pressure of time constraint?]]></description>

Although your resume alone won’t get you a job it is a great way to attract attention to you and make sure you at least get that interview. You will need to make it as eye caching as possible but also in a professional manner. This is your chance to get your dream job so make sure to make an impression.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Resumes certainly do make a huge difference. So many people just go a generic resume for all kinds of different jobs they are applying to and don&#039;t realize that this is why they are having such a hard time landing a job. I actually have around three different resumes when I&#039;m applying to jobs depending on the field and then I usually just talk about my hobbies, etc in a cover letter. Both are very important to finding a good job.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For anyone who is putting together their resume the most important thing to do is make sure that another person proofreads it. Better yet, have three or more people proofread your resume. Most people spend so much time on their resume that they begin reading things they want to say and it, but those things are actually in the resume. It&#039;s a missed word here or there, or a misspelling that they just don&#039;t see. Resumes are one of those things that people spend so much time on they often miss the obvious. That&#039;s why it&#039;s so important to have a fresh set of eyes take a look at it before you send it out.]]></description>
