					<description><![CDATA[aepending on whether you’re using active or passive voice, your simple present tense verb may fall into the past tense. Crazy? Not really. Here’s an example: “The dog catches the ball.” That’s clearly active voice. The first noun (dog) acts out the verb (catches).

But if you say “The ball is caught by the dog,” magic happens. Because the first noun (ball) is acted upon by an external agency (the dog), who performs the verb (to catch) the verb becomes past tense. This works with any passive voice simple present tense sentence: “The moon is illuminated by the sun,” or “The barking is done by the dog” or “The stock exchange is affected by the value of the dollar.”

Those are the basic rules when it comes to the simple present tense in English. If you weren’t able to get 100% on the exercises above, you can now try again with your new knowledge of how this tense works!]]></description>

There are a lot of people learning English as a second or third language. Would you say the same thing about Spanish if you were trying to learn it? You might want to try to think outside your own lie to others who may not be in the same position as you. Just because you happen to be a native English speaker doesn&#039;t mean that everybody is.]]></description>

When you get on all the Social Media sites these days it is pretty obvious that not everyone is able to construct sentences in a proper way anymore. It’s really encouraging to see a post like this which actually can help to improve grammar.]]></description>
