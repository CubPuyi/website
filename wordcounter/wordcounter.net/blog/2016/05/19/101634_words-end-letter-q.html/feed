Q must be one of the most difficult letters to use in the alphabet but this sure showed a few new words to use. Thank you for the effort. You sure do learn something new each day.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A lot of words I didn&#039;t know about, but yeah, as I expected, most are not English in origin. This would be good for Scrabble, but not much else. They are not really words that I would ever find myself using in regular life, but still pretty interesting.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m actually surprised at the number of words that end with Q. I came here thinking there may be a handful of these type of Q words, but was surprised that there were more than I anticipated. It would be good to keep these in hand when I&#039;m playing games like Scrabble. I can&#039;t wait to play the word &quot;Suq&quot; one of these days, and hopefully some of the longer words as well.]]></description>
