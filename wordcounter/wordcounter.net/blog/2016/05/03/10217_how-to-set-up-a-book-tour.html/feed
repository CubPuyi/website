Hello! I am a new author and my first book come out in the spring of 2022. What I noticed was some authors don&#039;t have the time or the know how to even begin book touring. In many of my conversations with other writers I ask how are you going to promote your work! The answer I mainly get is I don&#039;t know. My reply back to the author is while your book is bring created also look into marketing strategies this is a topic many over look.]]></description>

I find that most people even some family members want you to give them a copy instead of helping you to promote it and some even have asked to read it but never make a commitment.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is what authors often don&#039;t realize when they write a book. It doesn&#039;t just sell itself. You have to get out there and promote it so people can find it to read it. I think a lot fewer people would dream about being writers if they knew how much promotion that they have to do on top of all the writing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As someone who has done book tours, the image and the reality are far different. The image is there are a lot of adoring fans wanting to meet and greet you and tell you how much they loved the book. In reality, it&#039;s a trudge from bookstore to bookstore hoping there are enough people there to buy a few copies of the book. You have to be a salesperson, and that isn&#039;t what a lot of writers are. It&#039;s one of those things where &quot;be careful what you wish for&quot; is pertinent.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve always wanted to do a book tour. It&#039;s actually a dream of mine, but there are so many costs involved with doing it. You have to already have a good amount of money to be able to do it, and it&#039;s just not possible to do it as a struggling writer. I hope one day to be successful enough that I can go on a book tour, but it&#039;s just not possible right now. I better get back to writing...]]></description>
