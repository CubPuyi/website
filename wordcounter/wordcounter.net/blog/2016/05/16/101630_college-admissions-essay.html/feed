When the college admission people read through your essay I would say they look to see who you are as a person. For that reason, I think this article will help to get started. It is important to make an impression but also be truthful about all your achievements and accomplishments.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is an essay about yourself and also this is the first impression the college will have of you so I think it is very important to actually be yourself and not try to impress anyone because this is all about what you have learned, achieved and worked for.]]></description>

I&#039;m sure that colleges read the admissions essays. This is not an essay just for credit, as in high school. Colleges are making a reputation for themselves. If they are known to have many successful students, then they will be able to have better teachers and more money for their school. They definitely read them.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Do they really read the college admission essays? I know my high school teachers didn&#039;t read my essays. I would put  a sentence in them to see if they were really reading them, and none of them ever noticed it. I bet college admission people do the same thing, or maybe only read the first paragraph or two.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I would be very careful with the &quot;be controversial&quot; suggestion in this article. What you want to do is stand out, but you don&#039;t want to stand out in a bad way. Too many times taking a contrary view or controversial view makes you look opinionated and not open-minded. I would suggest that you concentrate on what you have learned from your accomplishments rather than try to come up with a controversy to get yourself noticed.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The thing I was taught by my teacher when it came to college admission essays is to focus on what and how you learned from your accomplishments, not the actual accomplishments.  The accomplishments speak for themselves but having the maturity to realize what you learned from them is what can make you stand out from the crowd.]]></description>
