					<description><![CDATA[If you&#039;re a writer, having a blog is a wonderful way to promote your work. Anybody who comes to your blog and regularly reads it is somebody who will potentially by your book. In this day and age, if you can build a large following on a blog, it will be much easier to find somebody to represent your writing because that following will make selling the book that much easier.
