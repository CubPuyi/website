					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordcounter.net/blog/2016/07/13/101887_how-to-write-a-review.html#comments/7395&quot;&gt;really?&lt;/a&gt;.

I think it depends a lot on the type of review that your writing. If you&#039;re writing a review for a travel website or Amazon or something like that, I don&#039;t think writing a review is all that difficult. You can just state your opinion on whatever product or service you used. 

If, however, you&#039;re writing a review for some type of publication, it&#039;s a little bit more complicated. You need to do research and put a little bit of thought and planning into it. It can&#039;t just be stream of conscious writing which you often see in the above type of reviews.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I would like to encourage anybody who reads this article to take the time and honestly review stuff that you buy. If you&#039;ve ever read a review and it&#039;s helped you make a decision, by taking the time to give your opinion on a product or service you can help somebody make a good decision to. There are so many people who are now writing false reviews that it&#039;s even more important for people to write real ones so the truth about products and services comes out.]]></description>
