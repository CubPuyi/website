I hope your friend is doing all right now, and I would absolutely love to confront the people who make fun of him when you talk to them. For some cracked reason people think horrible, painful, sad, awful things are so funny..... as long as it doesn&#039;t happen to them.]]></description>

Exactly! Someone probably thought it would be funny to name it long like that, but if there really is a phobia of long words, it really isn&#039;t all that funny. Sure, you can joke about it if you don&#039;t actually have a fear of long words, but if someone does it&#039;s just cruel.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I actually had a friend who suffered from this. You would think that it would be something that would be funny, but it&#039;s actually quite sad. Maybe driving down the road and there&#039;d be a road sign with a really long name of an exit or town and he would just kind of freak out. Whenever I tell people about it, their first reaction is to laugh and make fun of it, but if you ever saw somebody who actually has this fear you&#039;d realize that it&#039;s not a laughing matter.]]></description>
