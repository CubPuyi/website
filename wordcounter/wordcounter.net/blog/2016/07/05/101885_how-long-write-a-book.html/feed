					<description><![CDATA[The problem is that so many people know this now and they create &quot;click bait&quot; titles. That is, titles that don&#039;t have anything really to do with the article, or which misrepresent the article, just so you click. It&#039;s effective, but misleading and I hate them.]]></description>

If you&#039;re worried about the time it will take and if anyone will read it, then you really don&#039;t want to write a book. You just like the image of you writing a book. If you really wanted to write a book, these things wouldn&#039;t even be a consideration in your thoughts.]]></description>

It&#039;s pretty conceited of you to assume that you are the standard when it comes to writing books. No two people are the same, so the amount of time it takes to write a book for each person will be different. Your statement is like me saying anybody who doesn&#039;t know how to scuba dive is stupid just because I happen to enjoy scuba diving. It doesn&#039;t make any sense at all advancing your own thoughts and skills on somebody else.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think it depends on each person. Some people are able to write books quickly while others it will take a lot of time. There is not a specific time for everyone as each book is different. I think each person should set a realistic goal as to when they want to be done and shoot for that goal. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I want to write a book, but I&#039;m not sure I want to spend all the time it would take to write it. I&#039;m afraid that I will spend a year and then nobody will want to read it. If that happens, I will have wasted a year of my life. How do you write a book when you want to, but you don&#039;t think it will be good enough for people to enjoy?]]></description>
