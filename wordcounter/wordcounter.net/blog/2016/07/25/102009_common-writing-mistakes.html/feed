If a student makes a common writing mistake, it&#039;s usually due to laziness. They didn&#039;t want to take the time to reread what they wrote or they did it last minute so they didn&#039;t have the time to do it. It&#039;s true that it&#039;s easy to see which students decided to be lazy on an assignment and which ones took it seriously.]]></description>

I&#039;m also a teacher. It&#039;s easy to tell who has and hasn&#039;t proofread their papers. Really easy mistakes to correct if the students read through the paper once time, but didn&#039;t. It tells me they really didn&#039;t care about the work they did.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Most of the writing mistakes I see as a teacher are ones that the students know, they just don&#039;t proofread to catch them. If students would learn to proofread, most of their grades would significantly increase. It&#039;s just laziness, but it&#039;s so difficult to correct since it has to be the students who want to do it.]]></description>
