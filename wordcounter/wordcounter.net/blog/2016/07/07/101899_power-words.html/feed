					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordcounter.net/blog/2016/07/07/101899_power-words.html#comments/6986&quot;&gt;Deniz&lt;/a&gt;.

To some degree you&#039;re correct, but to the other degree you&#039;re completely wrong. Negative words are rarely power words. For example, think of the words &quot;sloth&quot; I don&#039;t think that anybody would ever consider the word sloth to be a power word. In this sense, power words can&#039;t be any word. On the other hand, if it&#039;s a positive word, you can likely be used as a power word in some way.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome to advertising 101. Words affect people and the words that you use can influence people in ways that they didn&#039;t even realize they could be influenced. There&#039;s a reason that advertising copy editors make a lot of money. I did one can sell products simply through their description whether there actually any good or not. Power words are powerful and if you learn to use them, you can make your writing and speech much more powerful as well.]]></description>
