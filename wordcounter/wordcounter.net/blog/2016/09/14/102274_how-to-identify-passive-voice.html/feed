But both is passive voice. Not because of the was, but because the was is a helping verb which isn´t nessecary.
&quot;I was walking down the street&quot; - &quot;I walked down the street&quot;
&quot;Jennifer&#039;s birthday was fast approaching&quot; - &quot;Jennifer&#039;s birthday approached fast&quot;
Not passive voice:
&quot;The tree was green&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Please PLEASE can you make it clear that the use of the word &#039;was&#039; does NOT always—or even usually—indicate passive voice?  This is SUCH a common misconception.

I have had people authoritatively state that &quot;I was walking down the street&quot; is passive voice.  Why?  Because ...&#039;was.&#039;

Ditto &quot;Jennifer&#039;s birthday was fast approaching, so I needed to find her a present.&quot;

I think this misconception is far more widespread AND damaging than the mistaken idea that passive voice is bad. Whether it&#039;s bad or not, in specific instances, can&#039;t be determined unless the writer actually recognises it.  (Spot the passive voice in that sentence.  No &#039;was&#039; to be seen there.)

If people MUST look for a shortcut, I&#039;d say keeping an eye out for &#039;was being&#039; is a better indicator. Again, not foolproof.  But better than just &#039;was.&#039;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My client just told me I can&#039;t write &quot;this problem can cause x symptoms,&quot; because that&#039;s passive voice. So, she requires me to say, &quot;this problem causes x symptoms.&quot; I feel this is wrong. After all, it doesn&#039;t always cause those symptoms. Is that really passive voice, or is it just being accurate?]]></description>
