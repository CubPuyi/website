So Oxford and Websters dictionaries aren&#039;t real dictionaries? They&#039;re just slang internet dictionaries?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My 21 year old daughter uses the word &quot;couth&quot; all of the time. She seems to be quite fond of it. However, her personality is quite &quot;uncouth&quot; and she&#039;ll be the first to admit it. For a 21 year old girl to use an old-world term, to me, is beautiful in and of itself. What passes as acceptable English language today, is quite scary. Instructors in college even speak with modern euphemisms that seem unprofessional, at best. Quite distasteful in my opinion, but tact is also a lost art in modern day language.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[hmmm. If &quot;couth&quot; formerly meant someone familiar or part of the group, is it then possible that it evolved into the word &quot;kith&quot;, as in &quot;kith and kin&quot;? (mayhaps its usage dates to the Middle English?)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Couth just seems extremely strange for me to even say. I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever heard it actually used in a real conversation although I have heard on to uncouth many times. Is this really a thing?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Very good article. I feel there are a number of words like &quot;couth&quot; that I have heard recently that  don&#039;t seem to be real words, but people know the meaning of the word. Does that make sense?]]></description>
