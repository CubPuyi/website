					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s painfully obvious when students use only spell check and grammar check and don&#039;t actually proofread their essays. Technology is great and can help students write better, but only if they do the basics as well. If they only rely on the technology and not rereading their writing, it&#039;s going to end up worse. It used to be that students had to reread and proofread their essays because there was no other way to  check it. In some ways, essays are getting worse because spell check makes them lazier.]]></description>
