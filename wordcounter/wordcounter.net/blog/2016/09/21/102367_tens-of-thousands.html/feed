I don&#039;t think this is correct. Sure, it&#039;s not an exact number, but it gives a general idea of the crowd. There is a mental difference between dozens at the game, hundreds at the game, thousands at the game and tens of thousands at the game. While none of those numbers is specific, you can create an mental image of how many people are at the game with each one, and each will be different.]]></description>

Yes, in a general sense you are correct, but tens of thousands is such a broad amount that they can be quite confusing. There&#039;s a huge difference between 20,000 and 90,000 just like there&#039;s a huge difference between 2 million and 9 million.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s the issue I have with numbers like this. They don&#039;t really mean anything. Basically, you&#039;re saying &quot;a really big number&quot; so if you wouldn&#039;t put that in a sentence, then you shouldn&#039;t use tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, tens of millions, hundreds of millions or any other number like that.

Saying &quot;there were tens of thousands of people at the game&quot; is no different than saying &quot;there were a really big number of people at the game&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think it&#039;s rather apparent what tens of thousands means. It means exactly what it says. It isn&#039;t that difficult to understand. ]]></description>
