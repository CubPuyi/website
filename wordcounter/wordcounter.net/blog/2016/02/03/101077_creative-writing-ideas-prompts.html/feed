					<description><![CDATA[I love these Prompts! I will totally use one or two in my Fan Fiction I&#039;m doing. Its Pokemon! This is a little bit of it:

It‚Äôs a beautiful morning in Petalburg City, and it seems that we have a new hero. Lets go see what she‚Äôs doing‚Ä¶

‚ÄúBrooke, your brothers are down stairs.‚Äù My mom said in a whisper, I opened my eyes and saw she was kneeling at my bed side. It was sunny out today, which was great for playing out side!

‚ÄúReally?‚Äù I asked in a sleepy voice, my mom nodded, ‚ÄúOkay, I just need to get dressed.‚Äù I ran over to my closet and went inside. I looked at all my clothes, then remembered it was my birthday today! I grabbed my favorite shirt and shorts. My shirt was an orange long sleeve, and my shorts were bright blue. I was turning ten that day and I was so excited! It meant I could get a Pokemon! But I was more excited to see my brothers, I hadn‚Äôt seen them sense they left to go on their journeys. I rushed over to my tall mirror. I put some of my long blue hair up in a bun, and left the rest down. Then I opened my bedroom door and ran down stairs. When I got at the bottom of the stair case, I smelled my dad‚Äôs pancakes!

‚ÄúHappy birthday Brooke!‚Äù He said as I sat at the table. He putt three pancakes on my plate and covered them in maple syrup. Then I noticed my brothers were in the other room! I immediately jumped out of my chair and ran over.

‚ÄúRon, Gab, I missed you guys!‚Äù I exclaimed hugging them both.]]></description>

&quot;A child from the year 2300 travels back to our time. How and why? What do they find surprising (or even horrifying) about our daily lives?&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What is the best way to choose a writing prompt from this list? Is it better to go through the list and pick one that speaks to you, or pick a random one and use that? is one way more effective than the other and if I should choose a random one, how do I choose a random number for this?]]></description>

Although writing is something that comes naturally to some people, not everyone is this lucky. It helps to have prompts like this to practice writing, but also the creative aspect of writing. I am thankful that I am not one who has a lot of trouble with writing, but I do need to practice to be better. I look forward to trying out some of these prompts in the future.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for sharing this creative ideas list..the best thing you can do is practice writing every single day. But we know sometimes it can be hard to think of what to write about.You get better at any skill through practice, and creative writing prompts are a great way to practice writing.Dreaming of doing something and starting it, in reality, has a lot of difference. Sometimes we need a push to take the first step. Though some of the top institutes have made it easier for the individuals to learn the skills through short-term writing courses and convert their hobby into their career.]]></description>
