					<description><![CDATA[The fictional characters are not only dealt with in the first half of the book.  They are dealt with throughout the book.  The second half introduces more essays but they are very well integrated into the fictional threads, which all reach their climax in the second half.  I recommend reading the book in full.  It is worth it!]]></description>
