And i was taught by an old school teacher, she was positive you were to use comas, it let the reader flow with the sentence.not every pause in. Spoken language deserves a coma when the words are written down, but as you read back your work its easy at times, to figure out where they go. Yeah sometimes I&#039;m wrong, but I&#039;d rater have that extra one in my story, than not have one where its really needed. I love our language, writing, conveying thoughts, relating to others, teaching and entertaining. It can be such a beautiful thing, yet ugly too. All in the beholders heart.]]></description>

Context is key. If you&#039;re trying to communicate and want to maximize your chances of being understood, then the Oxford comma is essential. In a text to a friend grammar isn&#039;t as necessary to being understood.]]></description>

Never say never... Don&#039;t use a comma before &quot;and&quot; or &quot;but&quot; except, as clearly explained in the text above, to avoid misunderstanding and confusion. Use common sense :)]]></description>

While I agree that the Oxford comma is necessary, your examples are faulty because, in the first example, if we assume that macaroni and cheese is a singular item, then there is no need for the first comma, and it is, in fact, a grammatical error; whereas, in the second example, we are to assume that all three items are separate, which renders the first &quot;and&quot; unnecessary.]]></description>
