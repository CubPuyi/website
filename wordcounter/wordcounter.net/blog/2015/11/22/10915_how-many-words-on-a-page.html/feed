Just because you know how to do something doesn&#039;t mean you have to do it.  Being able to manipulate pages can be useful for good reasons, not just to increase page count. There will be time when you will need to fit important information into a certain page count, and this can be a useful skill to know.]]></description>

This sure is helpful if you get an essay where they only specify it must be 5 pages. That doesn&#039;t happen often these days. I find that you will always need a word count. teachers are too smart to let you manipulate how much you write by changing the page to your advantage.]]></description>
