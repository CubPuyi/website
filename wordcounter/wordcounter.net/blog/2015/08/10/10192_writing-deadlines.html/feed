					<description><![CDATA[How exactly do you meet your writing deadlines? I have a terrible time reaching my writing deadlines all the time. It&#039;s what&#039;s keeping me from being the writer I want to become. Even with my best intentions, I often fail to get the writing I&#039;m supposed to get written done on time. I just think I&#039;m a procrastinator and no matter what I try to do, and never seems to work out. Does this mean that I won&#039;t be able to be a writer?
