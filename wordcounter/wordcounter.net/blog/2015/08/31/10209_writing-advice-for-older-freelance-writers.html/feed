					<description><![CDATA[Hi Jennifer,
I like how you say not to mention potential turn offs too early in the piece - it&#039;s as though agents are looking for ways to filter their prospects and mentioning an age outside their preferred demographic is not a good way to start.
Being taken seriously and establishing some authority is all about being selective with what you share.
Thank You
