&quot;if they are well over, they are being too wordy.&quot;

Now here&#039;s something *I* don&#039;t get. I can understand being &quot;wordy&quot; as something bad if it&#039;s a student looking in a thesaurus to make every word more complicated, but I&#039;ve done essays where I&#039;ve covered all the points related to the topic I wanted to talk about, delivered them with examples and references where needed, and accidentally gone over the word limit to where I either have to make my essay weaker to not get points taken off OR get points taken off for being &quot;wordy&quot;? Why??]]></description>

Our teacher gave us a 20000 word count for the Australia Murray River Basin...   I&#039;d be lucky if my teachers ever give me a 2500 word count. Last year one of the students in our class scored a 38000 word count when the minimum word count was 25000. don&#039;t complain.

					<description><![CDATA[The word count at my University is a maximum word count, not a minimum. The word count is there to suggest the level of detail we&#039;re expected to go into. For example, my last essay had a 2,500 word maximum. I could easily have written a 10,000 word dissertation or a 100 word summary. For the detail expected. I ended up with 2,464 words. If you&#039;re writing 1,000 words for a 2,500 word essay, even if that seems OK to you, you&#039;ve not added enough detail.]]></description>
