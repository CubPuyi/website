					<description><![CDATA[Creativity, which lends itself almost fully to a good, great, and even mediocre novels, really does ebb and flow. It&#039;s not an on-demand skillet like, e.g. editing the finished work. Now, I for one prefer the novels I read to be the kind that are monumental. So yes, I am a novel snob if such a thing exists, however I still find my excuse, as you would have it labeled to be beyond reproach. Now, may we believe a writer who one day says &quot;I&#039;m burned out. That creative spark just isn&#039;t there anymore. My Muse, I hope, isn&#039;t dead.&quot; After telling their audience of loyal readers this due to false outrage stirred up via social media by the drove of people who&#039;ve suddenly found themselves lacking anything to read, and being outright humiliated by said false outrage along with having to give a public statement (as not all writers enjoy media campaigns), would you take them t their word and be patient? Or forget them and move on to subpar novelists?]]></description>
