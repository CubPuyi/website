If they are original characters (ones that you created) and avoid using identifying features such as the actual game names for objects or currency; you don&#039;t use sims game pictures but tell a narrative story; then it should be OK under fair use.  

I&#039;d suggest not using any hints that would allude to the fact that your inspiration comes from one of the Sims games.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi! I loved this article. I am a long time Sims enthusiast (though, essentially  I rarely play now. I may have a spurt and then I don&#039;t allow myself to play for months, because as you mentioned, it is a big huge time suck, and I work enough hours on the computer as is). I have had an idea for a book in my head for literally a decade, and while I could never make that one happen (yet!), I finally just started trying again with a totally different story line. I haven&#039;t gotten far but thought to myself that Sims might be helpful in building a character profile, and I googled &quot;using sims for writing.&quot; I enjoyed this read more than I care to admit and plan to try it out as soon as I get the chance! Thanks!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m doing exactly what you&#039;re doing, I think its an absolutely great idea for making or developing stories with idea&#039;s from the game, it really helps inspire you quickly, and sort of generates non-copied plots for you. This article was inspiring and helpful. :)]]></description>

Omg! I was gonna write a book about my sim characters but Iâ€™m not exactly sure if itâ€™s copywrited or under fair use if I end up publishing it. I need help on this one.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, my question may seem stupid. I&#039;m currently writing a fantasy comic, with a quite complete universe. I have a huge family tree involved in this (about 78 generations). The main points of it are clear, the tree has been drawn long ago, but currently I&#039;m using the Sims to help me fill some blanks for a clearer and more realistic result in my head. I&#039;m basically doing human (sim) breeding!

So my question is : if I happen to sell my works (let&#039;s dream big!), will it be subject to copyright issues, since I generated characters and some names (very tertiary characters, they probably won&#039;t even appear in the story) using help from the game?

Thanks for your reply.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Agreed! Speaking as a custom content addict, Sims 2 was the best in terms of graphics in my opinion but the later iterations have latched onto something great with the traits option. I wanna start a YouTube channel to feature some of my favourite families!]]></description>
