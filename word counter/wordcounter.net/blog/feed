										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Writing the English language is just as much an art as it is a science. No doubt, your schoolteachers gave you rules to stick to in class. But out in the real world, there’s more leeway than you may have realized.</p>
<p>Not to worry. You don’t need a master’s degree in publishing to be a good writer. If you follow these four tips anytime you write and edit, you’ll be able to turn out a quality email, report, or article.</p>
<h2>1. Be consistent</h2>
<p>Some aspects of good writing are rules. Others are style choices. So how can you tell which is which?</p>
<p>The easiest way is to <strong>pick and follow a style guide</strong>.</p>
<p>There are many style guides for English: <a href="https://www.apstylebook.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AP</a>, <a href="https://apastyle.apa.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">APA</a>, <a href="https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CMOS</a> (a.k.a., <strong>Chicago</strong>), <a href="https://style.mla.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MLA</a>, <a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/public-affairs/style-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oxford</a> &#8230; It depends what country you’re writing for and what you’re writing about. If you’re writing within a school or company, you may be asked to follow what’s called a <strong>house</strong> style guide, that is, a guide created specifically for that entity. Some newspapers like The Economist or The Guardian even stick to their own.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Style guide name (Short form):</strong></td>
<td><strong>Target audience:</strong></td>
<td><strong>Used in:</strong></td>
<td><strong>Notes:</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>AP</td>
<td>American journalists and reporters</td>
<td>News, media, broadcasting, magazine publishing, marketing, and public relations.</td>
<td>The most popular style for casual writing and anything online. Most bloggers use this style.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>APA</td>
<td>Students, academics, professionals</td>
<td>Agriculture, biology, business, chemistry, education, language and linguistics, nursing, psychology, social and behavioral sciences.</td>
<td>Focuses on clarity of communication and &#8220;word choice that best reduces bias in language&#8221;.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>CMOS</td>
<td>Academic publishers, book editors and authors, fiction writers</td>
<td>Humanities, social, historical and political sciences.</td>
<td>Specifically focuses on American English. <em>Turabian</em> follows CMOS.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Students and researchers</td>
<td>Arts and humanities, especially English, writing, literature, and related subjects like theater or film.</td>
<td>Focuses on brevity and clarity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Oxford</td>
<td>Oxford University staff, British students and writers.</td>
<td>An in-house guide that has grown into a general writing guide for students and editors.</td>
<td>Also known as &#8220;New Hart&#8217;s Rules&#8221;.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3>1.1 Which style guide should you pick?</h3>
<p>In the best case: the style that your readership considers correct.</p>
<p>Of course, this is not always possible. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s important to get into your readers&#8217; heads. For example, if the target audience of your text is teachers or professors, they will prefer the CMOS style to the AP style. For most other people, however, AP is more appropriate. This is true not only for people who write in AP style every day, such as journalists and PR professionals but also for people who don&#8217;t care what stylebook you use. Most online articles the average person reads on a daily basis are in AP style. If you stick to that they will most likely consider it &#8220;correct.&#8221;</p>
<h3>1.2 Guidelines evolve</h3>
<p>What’s more, some rules and guidelines change with the times. For example, until 2019, “African-American” took a hyphen per the AP Stylebook. Today, you’d write it without the hyphen: “African American.”</p>
<p>That’s why it’s important to keep up with style guide updates, which are sometimes issued as often as annually.</p>
<p>Don’t worry too much if learning the details of a certain style sounds complicated. Once you’re familiar with your style guide, many aspects of the English language are unlikely to change. For example, sentences will always end with one of three punctuation marks: a period, an exclamation point, or a question mark.</p>
<p>By getting a solid grasp of grammar rules as well as familiarizing yourself with style choices, you’ll be on the road to rockstar writing in no time.</p>

<h3>1.3 Oxford comma yes or no?</h3>
<p>Last but not least, you might wonder, whether you should use the Oxford comma (also called the serial comma).</p>
<p>You can read more about it <a href="https://wordcounter.net/blog/2019/04/30/103328_oxford-comma-2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<h2>2. Use the active voice</h2>
<p>In English, sentences typically follow the subject–verb–object pattern: “Emilio caught the ball.” This sentence is written in the active voice, meaning the subject is acting on the object.</p>
<p>However, you could also write, “The ball was caught by Emilio.” This sentence conveys the same idea, but it’s written in the passive voice. The object has become the subject.</p>
<p>Although there are cases in which passive voice can work well or even better than the active voice, most of the time, active voice is usually preferable. <strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p>For one thing, the active voice takes more words to say the same thing. If you’re keen to keep your readers’ eyes from tiring or save space, active voice rules.</p>
<p>Additionally, passive voice can sound vague. Take, for example, the following sentence: “The vase was smashed.”</p>
<p>Who exactly smashed the vase? We don’t know. That’s why the passive voice is used in certain instances where the writer wants to eliminate tagging a subject with responsibility. Examples include law and science.</p>
<h2>3. Punctuate right</h2>
<p>Punctuation marks can make a huge difference in meaning when stringing words together in a sentence. But getting punctuation right can be tricky.</p>
<p>Although you probably learned the basics of punctuation in grade school, there’s more to the marks than what you likely learned. That’s because like most aspects of the English language, punctuation is both art and science.</p>
<p>Here’s a list of the basics.</p>
<p><strong>Apostrophes</strong> make contractions and show possession.</p>
<p>No, you cant eat Sashas’ pie. (<span style="color: red;">✗</span>)<br />
No, you can’t eat Sasha’s pie. (<span style="color: green;">✓</span>)</p>
<p><strong>Colons</strong> introduce important information. They’re a way to say, “Now hear this!”</p>
<p>The reception menu includes: fish, chicken, and a vegetarian dish. (<span style="color: red;">✗</span>)<br />
The reception menu includes fish, chicken, and a vegetarian dish. (<span style="color: green;">✓</span>)</p>
<p>I found the book he wanted: a dusty, leather-bound dinosaur. (<span style="color: green;">✓</span>)</p>
<p>Javier gave me the news: The zombies had taken over. (<span style="color: green;">✓</span>)</p>
<p>Keep in mind that colons are used differently in American and British English, so again, check your style guide.</p>
<p><strong>Commas</strong> indicate pauses between words, phrases, and ideas. There’s an ongoing debate between people who prefer serial, or Oxford, commas and people who don’t. The important thing is to pick an approach and stick to it.</p>
<p>I need tape, paper, and markers. (<span style="color: green;">✓</span>)<br />
I need tape, paper and markers. (<span style="color: green;">✓</span>)</p>
<p>The president introduced his wife Janice. (<span style="color: red;">✗</span> unless the president is a bigamist)<br />
The president introduced his wife, Janice. (<span style="color: green;">✓</span>)</p>
<p>Seo-Jun was born in Seoul, Korea in 1999. (<span style="color: red;">✗</span>)<br />
Seo-Jun was born in Seoul, Korea, in 1999. (<span style="color: green;">✓</span>)</p>
<p>We went out to dinner, then we saw a movie. (<span style="color: red;">✗</span>: a comma splice)<br />
We went out to dinner. Then we saw a movie. (<span style="color: green;">✓</span>)</p>
<p><strong>Dashes</strong> come in different styles to serve different purposes. They’re different from hyphens.</p>
<p>That vase—the one in the corner needs more water. (<span style="color: red;">✗</span>)<br />
That vase—the one in the corner—needs more water. (<span style="color: green;">✓</span>)</p>
<p>I found the book he wanted—a dusty, leather-bound dinosaur. (<span style="color: green;">✓</span>)</p>
<p><strong>Hyphens</strong> are short lines that, among other things, turn two or more words into one idea.</p>
<p>My brother needs a conditioner for his bleach blond hair. (<span style="color: red;">✗</span>)<br />
My brother needs a conditioner for his bleach-blond hair. (<span style="color: green;">✓</span>)</p>
<p>It wasn’t your run of the mill mill. (<span style="color: red;">✗</span>)<br />
It wasn’t your run-of-the-mill mill. (<span style="color: green;">✓</span>)</p>
<p><strong>Semicolons</strong> are usually used to join two related sentences. But the fashion is to avoid them and simply write two separate sentences.</p>
<p>Don’t eat that; because it’ll make you sick. (<span style="color: red;">✗</span>)<br />
Don’t eat that, it’ll make you sick. (<span style="color: red;">✗</span>)<br />
Don’t eat that; it’ll make you sick. (<span style="color: green;">✓</span>)<br />
Don’t eat that. It’ll make you sick. (<span style="color: green;">✓</span>)</p>
<h2>4. Separate soundalikes</h2>
<p>The English language contains many words that sound like other words but mean something entirely different. These words are called <strong>homophones</strong>, and even current spellcheckers don’t always know the difference. That’s why you need to be aware of the most commonly confused words.</p>
<p>Here are some <strong>commonly confused word pairs</strong>. If you dig deeper, you can find many more to watch out for.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>You&#8217;re/Your</strong>:
<ul>
<li><em>You&#8217;re</em> is a contraction of &#8220;you are.&#8221;
<ul>
<li>&#8220;You&#8217;re such an attentive learner!&#8221;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Your</em> is the possessive form of <em>you</em>.
<ul>
<li>&#8220;Your reading speed depends on your ability to concentrate and process information quickly.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>To/Too</strong>:
<ul>
<li><em>To</em> is a preposition.
<ul>
<li>&#8220;She went to the gym.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Too</em> means &#8220;as well.&#8221;
<ul>
<li>&#8220;He went to the gym too.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Affect/Effect</strong>:
<ul>
<li>&#8220;To affect&#8221; means to influence or to change in some measure.
<ul>
<li>&#8220;Your mood can affect your relationship.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An <em>effect</em> is a result, consequence, or outcome.
<ul>
<li>&#8220;Yoga had a positive effect on my mood swings.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Then/Than</strong>:
<ul>
<li><em>Then</em> is used as an adverb, noun, or adjective to show the order of how things happened.
<ul>
<li>&#8220;He turned on the mic, then she started singing.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Than</em> is a subordinating conjunction for comparisons.
<ul>
<li>&#8220;He&#8217;s taller than her.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Accept/Except</strong>:
<ul>
<li><em>Accept</em> is a verb that means &#8220;to take&#8221; or &#8220;to receive.&#8221;
<ul>
<li>&#8220;He accepted the painting as a gift.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Except</em> is used as a preposition or conjunction to mean <em>but</em> or to form an exception:
<ul>
<li>&#8220;They looked at the whole property, except the garden.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong> Compliment/Complement </strong> :
<ul>
<li>&#8220;To compliment&#8221; means to say something nice about someone or something.
<ul>
<li>&#8220;She complimented their effort.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can also use <em>compliment</em> as a noun to describe &#8220;a polite expression of praise or admiration.&#8221;
<ul>
<li>&#8220;She received a beautiful compliment for her painting.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&#8220;To complement&#8221; means &#8220;to enhance&#8221; or &#8220;to complete.&#8221;
<ul>
<li>&#8220;Those red rims complement your car perfectly.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Again, by following these four simple tips, you can turn out a quality piece of writing every time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>“A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts.”<br />
―William Strunk Jr. and E.B. White, The Elements of Style</p></blockquote>
<p>You’ve probably come across more than one article, blog post, or product description that took way longer to get to the point.</p>
<p>In your frustration, you may have started skimming the piece, missing important information along the way.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you may have turned the page or clicked away.</p>
<p>Either way, you’ve wasted time, and the writer has wasted both their time and yours.</p>
<p>Creative writing offers a little more leeway with the use of language.</p>
<p>Depending on the genre in question, the setting of a story (fictional or real), or the character, flowery phrases may be appropriate to convey authenticity.</p>
<p>Song lyrics require an occasionally awkward turn of phrase to keep a line’s length and beat consistent with the others. The same goes for poetry in general.</p>
<p>Most other writing―be it journalism, business writing, or web writing―lends itself to a spare, even Spartan, style.</p>
<p>Unless a reader wants to be transported to another world, they probably just want you to get to the point. It’s not that they don’t want to hear what you have to say; it’s that they DO want to hear you. Right away.</p>
<p>Sandwiching your message between unneeded verbiage helps no one. It doesn’t make you sound smarter, clearer, or more persuasive. It’s. Just. Noise.</p>
<p>The next time you sit down to write, the burning question running through your mind after each period should be, “Do I really need to tell them this?”</p>
<p>Without further ado, here are <strong>330 examples of common cases of wordiness</strong> (as of Nov. 12, 2020), along with shorter alternatives.</p>
<p><strong>BUT</strong>: Keep a word or phrase if &#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>removing it ruins the grammatical structure.</li>
<li>it’s a key idea, fact, feeling, or description.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Debates among writers, editors, teachers, and others who use English are common. One of the longest-standing debates is that over the Oxford comma, aka the serial comma.</p>
<p>People arguing over a punctuation mark? As silly as it sounds, it’s been going on for decades.</p>
<p>If you’re not aware of this debate, we don’t want you to miss out on the fun and fastidiousness. Here’s an overview of the Oxford comma and why you might choose to use it.</p>
<h2>What is the Oxford comma?</h2>
<p>Oxford shirt, Oxford shoes &#8230; Oxford comma. Nope, the comma’s not related. But like certain fashions, the serial comma is adored by some and hated by others.<br />
In short, the Oxford comma is the optional comma before the final conjunction in a list or series.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>No worries; we’ll break it down for you.</p>
<p>When listing items in a written sentence, you use commas to separate the items, just as you’d normally pause between the items when speaking. (Note: Commas don’t always represent pauses in speech. To use commas this way is to use them incorrectly. However, in the case of listing items, there’s a parallel between verbal pauses and commas.)</p>
<p>Here’s an example of a sentence that contains a list of two items:</p>
<blockquote><p>I need to buy wine and toilet paper for the party.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s add one more item to that list:</p>
<blockquote><p>I need to buy eggs, wine, and toilet paper for the party.</p></blockquote>
<p>Aside from the odd shopping list (sounds like one crazy party!), did you notice anything unusual about that sentence? If you did, it’s probably because you’re not a supporter of the Oxford comma.</p>
<p>Here’s the same sentence without the Oxford comma:</p>
<blockquote><p>I need to buy eggs, wine and toilet paper for the party.</p></blockquote>
<p>This second version of the sentence is neither right nor wrong&#8211;just as the first isn’t either, either.</p>
<p>You see, English isn’t like math. The language isn’t governed 100 percent by hard rules. Whereas grammar is the science of English, style is the art of it.</p>
<p>And where serial commas are concerned, there are two schools of thought when it comes to style.</p>
<p>The philosophy of the Oxford comma is that a list should be consistent, with punctuation between each pair of items.</p>
<p>Those who argue against serial commas use this logic: A list of two items has no comma (e.g., I need to buy wine and toilet paper). So that shouldn’t change just because we add an item (e.g., I need to buy eggs, wine and toilet paper). The punctuation is only needed for three or more items.</p>
<p>The problem is that this latter reasoning doesn’t always hold up so well. You can find or come up with many examples of why the Oxford comma is usually the better choice.</p>
<h2>Why use the Oxford comma?</h2>
<p>Fans of the Oxford comma maintain that skipping it causes confusion in some cases. Let’s say you’re emailing a friend about some photos you took on your last vacation. You might write the following sentence:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’ll send you some photos of my grandparents, a hitchhiker and a skunk.</p></blockquote>
<p>The way this sentence is structured, it implies that you have some highly unusual DNA! In other words, using one comma here implies that one of your parents is the offspring of a hitchhiker and a skunk (let’s not picture the details).</p>
<p>But this surely wasn’t your intended meaning. And if you were to come across such a sentence by another writer, it should give you pause (pun intended).</p>
<p>Let’s see what happens when we add an Oxford comma:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’ll send you some photos of my grandparents, a hitchhiker, and a skunk.</p></blockquote>
<p>This sentence clearly states that you took photos of at least four subjects (depending on how many grandparents you captured in your shots). The hitchhiker and the skunk aren’t your grandparents.<br />
This example illustrates why many people feel the Oxford comma should be mandatory in writing.</p>
<h2>The history of the Oxford comma</h2>
<p>The Oxford comma is so named because it was used at Oxford University Press, the largest university press on the planet. Ironically, British writers seem to use the Oxford comma less than Americans do, which is why it stands out in the UK as an Oxford-prescribed <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/authors/author-guidelines/house-style/?lang=en&amp;cc=ch#ser" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">guideline</a>.</p>
<p>Many professional writers and editors have opined on the use of the Oxford comma. Some language lovers claim that adding one comma to a sentence can’t hurt and can only help in terms of clarity. Those on the other side of the fence feel that serial commas are prissy and unnecessary.</p>
<p>However, consider that a 2014 lawsuit, <a href="https://www.med.uscourts.gov/Opinions/Rich/2016/JHR_012616_2-14cv192_OConnor_v_Oakhurst.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">O’Connor v. Oakhurst Dairy</a>, revolved around a serial comma ambiguity. A list of labor activities exempt from overtime pay was open to misinterpretation. Hence, the dairy was ordered to pay $5 million in overtime wages to workers who performed the activities in the gray area.</p>
<p>If you’re in doubt, it’s usually worth it to add that comma.</p>
<h2>The Oxford comma in popular style guides</h2>
<p>So what do the big style guides have to say about such commas? Here’s a quick comparison of two major guides: Chicago and AP.</p>
<h3>The Oxford comma according to The Chicago Manual of Style</h3>
<p>The Chicago Manual of Style is a trustworthy guide for literature and academic writing. CMOS generally prescribes the Oxford comma, stating that it prevents confusion such as that shown above.</p>
<p>However, in some cases, as CMOS points out, even the Oxford comma can’t clarify a sentence. Recasting may be necessary at times. Look at this example:</p>
<blockquote><p>I emailed my father, the president, and the director of the FBI.</p></blockquote>
<p>In this sentence, it’s not clear as to whether your father is the president or a separate individual. In such a case, you can reword the sentence as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>I emailed my father as well as the president and the director of the FBI.</p></blockquote>
<p>or</p>
<blockquote><p>I emailed the president, the director of the FBI, and my father.</p></blockquote>
<p>(Reordering works only if the first two items are clearly separate and your readers know that the president doesn’t head the FBI.)</p>
<h3>The Oxford comma according to the AP Stylebook</h3>
<p>The AP Stylebook, the style bible of journalists and online writers, says <a href="https://www.codot.gov/business/grants/safetygrants/documents/APStyleGuideCheatSheet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">not to use</a> the Oxford comma in a simple series unless it’s needed to prevent confusion.</p>
<p>This is because traditionally, printed newspapers had space concerns when it came to adding text to a layout. Eliminating a few commas throughout a story might keep a story from running over into another column or page.</p>
<p>But AP admits that adding a comma before the final conjunction in a list makes sense in many cases.</p>
<h2>Oxford commas: the choice is yours</h2>
<p>If you’re writing a professional or academic article that must follow a chosen style guide, follow the Oxford comma rule in your guide. Some company style guides even instruct writers to generally follow AP style but to buck AP and use the Oxford comma.</p>
<p>In your personal or general business writing, you’re free to comma as you wish. Just be aware that your friends and colleagues may comment.</p>
<p>As with most style guidelines, when it comes to the Oxford comma, the most important thing is to commit to using it. Anyway you splice it, it’s hard to criticize attentively produced, consistent writing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Who</em> or <em>whom</em>? The question trips up even grammar-lovers. And in many circles, <em>whom</em> is becoming obsolete, which may sadden grammar purists.</p>
<p>Although <em>who</em> and <em>whom</em> are similar, each serves a distinct purpose. In order to understand how to use these pronouns correctly, you’ll have to refresh yourself on sentence structure.</p>
<p>Once you’ve got this down and compared several examples, you’ll be able to remember how to use <em>who</em> and <em>whom</em> quite easily.</p>
<h2>Parts of a sentence: a quick refresher</h2>
<p>The basic parts of a sentence are the subject and the predicate. The predicate must include a verb but may also include an object.</p>
<p>The subject is the person or thing that acts. The verb describes the action. The object is the person or thing that’s acted upon by a verb or preposition.</p>
<p>Clearly, sentences can get far more complicated than this. But this is the basic structure of a sentence.</p>
<p>In English, the standard order of a declarative sentence, or statement, is subject—verb—object. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tyrone bought the pizza.</li>
<li>Maria likes Jorge.</li>
<li>My children are watching TV.</li>
<li>The Kahdims are my neighbors.</li>
<li>Our boss called the police.</li>
</ul>
<p>We’re going to come back to these sentences further along as we explain <em>who</em> versus <em>whom</em>.</p>
<h2>Who</h2>
<p><em>Who</em> is a pronoun that replaces or refers to the singular or plural subject of a sentence. <em>Who</em> can be used in a question or a statement.</p>
<p>This famous book title by Stieg Larsson includes <em>who</em>:</p>
<p>“The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet’s Nest”</p>
<p>Now, look at this headline:</p>
<p>“Couple who missed Royal Caribbean cruise in viral video was celebrating honeymoon”<br />
<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/travel/couple-who-missed-royal-caribbean-cruise-in-bahamas-was-on-honeymoon-traveler-reveals" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fox News</a></p>
<p>Here are some other examples of how to use <em>who</em> in a sentence:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who do you think you are?</li>
<li>I wonder who’s at the door.</li>
<li>Who wants to go swimming?</li>
<li>Tell me who did this.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, let’s go back to our original examples and use who to form a question from each statement.</p>
<ul>
<li>Who bought the pizza? (<em>Who</em> replaces “Tyrone.”)</li>
<li>Who likes Jorge? (<em>Who</em> replaces “Maria.”)</li>
<li>Who’s watching TV? (<em>Who</em> replaces “my children.”)</li>
<li>Who are your neighbors? (<em>Who</em> replaces “the Kahdims,” the subject—not “neighbors,” the object.)</li>
<li>Who called the police? (<em>Who</em> replaces “our boss.”)</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll take the idea further and develop the original examples into statements that relate to or directly answer the questions above.</p>
<ul>
<li>I never found out who bought the pizza.</li>
<li>I don’t care who likes Jorge.</li>
<li>You tell me who’s watching TV!</li>
<li>I didn’t ask who your neighbors are.</li>
<li>I know who called the police.</li>
</ul>
<p>To recap, who replaces or refers to the subject of a sentence.</p>
<h2>Whom</h2>
<p><em>Whom</em> is a pronoun that replaces the singular or plural object of a sentence. <em>Whom</em> can be used in a question or a statement.</p>
<p>One of the most famous uses of <em>whom</em> is in this classic book title by Ernest Hemingway:</p>
<p>“For Whom the Bell Tolls”</p>
<p>Now, look at this headline:</p>
<p>“A Singer for Whom Words Always Came First”<br />
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/arts/music/sanford-sylvan-appraisal.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The New York Times</a></p>
<p>Right away, you can probably sense a difference between <em>whom</em> and <em>who</em>, even if you can’t put your finger on it.</p>
<p>In these two examples, <em>whom</em> is followed by a preposition, but this isn’t always the case. With a direct object, a preposition isn’t necessary.</p>
<p>You’ll also notice that a clause (a sentencelike phrase including both a subject and a verb) follows <em>whom</em>.</p>
<p>Let’s look at using <em>whom</em> in a sentence. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>To whom am I speaking?</li>
<li>Whom are you calling?</li>
<li>Don’t tell me whom to spend time with!</li>
<li>With whom did you dance?</li>
<li>Whom did the factory hire?</li>
<li>I have no idea whom I’ll marry.</li>
<li>By whom is he standing?</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s go back to our original sentences. We’ll expand one of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maria likes Jorge.</li>
<li>My children are watching TV with Nana.</li>
</ul>
<p>To turn these sentences into questions, note the different uses of <em>who</em> and <em>whom</em>. First:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who likes Jorge?</li>
<li>Whom does Maria like?</li>
</ul>
<p>And:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who’s watching TV with Nana?</li>
<li>With whom are your children watching TV?</li>
</ul>
<p>But also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who’s watching TV with your children?</li>
<li>With whom is Nana watching TV?</li>
</ul>
<p>To recap, <em>whom</em> replaces or refers to the object of a verb or preposition.</p>
<h2>The modern use of <em>who</em></h2>
<p>In casual conversations today, you’ll hear things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who are your kids watching TV with?</li>
<li>Who did Tyrone buy the pizza for?</li>
</ul>
<p>This is one of those lazy-grammar habits that’s become marginally acceptable in speech and even in some writing. But if you want to be taken seriously and to come across smartly in your writing, it’s always better to use <em>whom</em> when it’s called for.</p>
<p>In fact, <a href="https://afterdeadline.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/09/29/the-case-of-who-v-whom-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The New York Times</a> addressed this who–whom laziness, or perhaps ignorance, in a 2015 blog post. You’d do well to follow their lead.</p>
<h2>How to use <em>who</em> and <em>whom</em> correctly</h2>
<p>Both pronouns can be used in questions or statements.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Who</em> replaces the subject of a sentence.</li>
<li><em>Whom</em> replaces the object of a sentence.</li>
</ul>
<p>An easy way to determine if you should use <em>who</em> or <em>whom</em> is to see if <em>he</em> or <em>him</em> fits into the sentence. (Of course, <em>she</em> and <em>her</em> work too, but <em>he</em> and <em>him</em> sound more like <em>who</em> and <em>whom</em>, so it’s a simpler test.)</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>He bought this book. &gt; Who bought this book?</li>
<li>Him bought this book. &gt; Nope!</li>
<li>I gave the book to he. &gt; Nope!</li>
<li>I gave the book to him. &gt; To whom did you give the book?</li>
</ul>
<p>In casual speech and writing, <em>whom</em> is becoming somewhat obsolete. But for formal speech and writing, always use <em>whom</em> when it’s called for.</p>
<p>Note that if you’re developing a story character who’s young or doesn’t have an advanced education, your character likely won’t be throwing <em>whom</em> around in their dialogue.</p>
<p>If you’re writing anything else, stick with <em>whom</em> … so a bell doesn’t toll for your reputation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Don’t let the difference between <em>affect</em> and <em>effect</em> affect your self-confidence. Learning these two words is a cinch.</p>
<p>You might get away with not knowing the difference when speaking, as these two words are usually homophones (soundalikes). But your basic spell-checker won’t always catch a usage error if you type a correctly spelled version of a word.</p>
<p>In their most common usage, <em>affect</em> is a verb and<em> effect</em> is a noun. But each word can be either part of speech. Don’t worry! We’ll clear up the confusion for you.</p>
<h2>Affect</h2>
<p>So, is<em> affect</em> a verb or a noun? Well, it can be both.</p>
<p>But the most common definition of <em>affect</em> is “to alter” or “to act upon.”</p>
<p>Look at this headline:</p>
<p>&#8220;New Study Examines How Tiny Gas Pockets Affect 3D Printing&#8221;<br />
<a href="https://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2019/february/3d-printing-gas-pockets.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carnegie Mellon University</a></p>
<p>If you don’t already know the facts, there’s no way to tell whether the gas pockets make good or bad changes—or both.</p>
<p>Here are some more examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alcohol affects your ability to drive.</li>
<li>Both humans and animals affect the climate.</li>
<li>My brother’s new romance is affecting his work.</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, so all three of these examples sound as if <em>affect</em> is only used in the sense of a negative change. That isn’t always true. Check out these sentences:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exercise affects your metabolism for hours afterward.</li>
<li>Pets can affect your mood and physical health.</li>
<li>My brother’s new haircut is affecting his sales performance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Did my brother’s haircut turn him into a rock-star salesperson, or did it turn off his leads and prospects? There’s no way to be sure, as <em>affect</em> is a neutral verb.</p>
<p>Of course, most people know that alcohol impairs your ability to drive. But if you want to be super-clear to your audience, you may want to choose a more specific verb than <em>affect</em>.</p>
<p>Again, <em>affect</em> usually means “to alter” or “to act upon.” A great way to distinguish <em>affect</em> from effect is to remember that <em>affect</em>, <em>alter</em>, and <em>act</em> all start with “A.”</p>
<h2>Other meanings of <em>affect</em> as a verb</h2>
<p>You’re going to run across other cases where <em>affect</em> is a verb, but with a different meaning. In fact, you’ll see several dictionary definitions of <em>affect</em>. Here are a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>To feign</li>
<li>To cultivate</li>
<li>To tend toward</li>
<li>To frequent</li>
</ul>
<p>Luckily, most of these definitions aren’t all that common anymore. Just focus on the primary definition that we’ve explained in detail above.</p>
<h2>Affect as a noun</h2>
<p>Wait, what? That’s right: <em>Affect</em> can be a noun. But again, don’t worry too much about this, as you’re not likely to confuse this <em>affect</em> with an <em>effect</em>.</p>
<p>For one, <em>affect</em> as a noun is pronounced differently than the verb. The noun form has its stress on the first syllable and a short “A” sound.</p>
<p>Also, this word is more commonly used in the realms of medicine and psychology. The meaning of <em>affect</em> here is “the signs of an emotional state.”</p>
<p>For example, a psychiatric client may be described as having a flat affect. This means that, regardless of the client’s inner experience or feelings, they appeared to the observer to have no emotion at all.</p>
<p>So, if you see <em>affect</em> used this way, you’ll surely be able to understand the difference.</p>
<h2>Effect</h2>
<p>Now, is <em>effect</em> a verb or a noun? Well, again, it’s both. But we’re going to clarify the word for you.</p>
<p>Look at this headline:</p>
<p>&#8220;Peppa Effect: Canadian Kids Are Talking With English Accents Thanks To &#8216;Peppa Pig'&#8221;<br />
<a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2019/02/14/peppa-pig-accent-kids_a_23669624/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HuffPost</a></p>
<p>An effect is an end or event. Here are some more examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alcohol has an effect on your ability to drive.</li>
<li>Both humans and animals have an effect on the climate.</li>
<li>My brother’s new romance is having an effect on his work.</li>
</ul>
<p>Do these sentences sound familiar? You got it: They’re almost identical to three of the examples for <em>affect</em>.</p>
<p>This shows that affecting something yields an effect. This pair of words is simply two sides of the same coin.</p>
<p>You may have noticed that using <em>effect</em> instead of <em>affect</em> lengthens these sentences unnecessarily. Choosing strong verbs is a sign of advanced writing, so using <em>affect</em> is theoretically the better choice. But these sentences are still correct.</p>
<p>Here are some more efficient examples of using <em>effect</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the side effects of this medicine?</li>
<li>It’s a matter of cause and effect.</li>
<li>Perfumes have a bad effect on my allergies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, <em>effect</em> usually means to an end or event. A great way to distinguish <em>effect</em> from <em>affect</em> is to remember that <em>effect</em>, <em>end</em>, and <em>event</em> all start with “E.”</p>
<h2>Effect as a verb</h2>
<p><em>Effect</em> has several other definitions as a noun, but these definitions aren’t the ones that are commonly confused with <em>affect</em>.</p>
<p>The interesting thing, though, is that <em>effect</em> can also be a verb. This is probably the trickiest part of the whole matter.</p>
<p>Because <em>effect</em> means “to cause to exist.”</p>
<p>It’s okay! This isn’t exactly the same meaning as that of the verb <em>affect</em>. Remember, <em>affect</em> means &#8220;to alter&#8221; or &#8220;act upon.&#8221; In other words, &#8220;to change something,&#8221; not to cause or create it.</p>
<p>Look at this headline:</p>
<p>&#8220;Never Underestimate the Power of Young People to Effect Change&#8221;<br />
<a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/elisa-birnbaum/never-underestimate-the-power-of-young-people-to-effect-change_a_23375517/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HuffPost</a></p>
<p>Young people aren’t changing change! They’re bringing it about.</p>
<p>Read these other examples, and you’ll notice the difference immediately:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pollution effects climate change.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pollution affects the climate, but it doesn’t effect the climate itself. See?</p>
<p>Now, look at this:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Boston Tea Party effected the American Revolution.</li>
</ul>
<p>This means, as you probably know, that the Boston Tea Party came first. If the tea party had affected the revolution, the revolution would’ve already been underway.</p>
<h2>How to use <em>affect</em> and <em>effect</em> correctly</h2>
<p>Usually:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;To affect&#8221; means to change, influence, modify, or transform something.</li>
<li>An effect is a result, outcome, reaction, or product.</li>
</ul>
<p>We know you’ve got this. Go forth and use <em>affect</em> and <em>effect</em> confidently!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever taken notes during a lecture or meeting, looked at them later, and found them useless? We’ve all done it.</p>
<p>Even worse is when somebody asks to borrow your notes and quickly hands them back to you, saying, “Never mind, thanks.”</p>
<p>It’s ironic that many schools don’t give lessons on how to study or take notes effectively. These skills were addressed in an orientation class in my first year of college—which was a bit late if you ask me.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’re a student or professional writer, you’re likely familiar with English style guides. Although you learned many rights and wrongs in your English classes, not every aspect of the language is black or white.</p>
<p>Many style guides exist for English, and each serves a different role. Students may be familiar with APA or MLA style, which we don’t cover in this post. Nor will we cover <em>The Gregg Reference Manual</em>, a common resource for business writing, or British styles such as Oxford.<br />
In this article, we’ll highlight two American style guides: <em>The Chicago Manual of Style</em> and the <em>AP Stylebook</em>. We’ll cover six categories: punctuation, capitalization, numbers, abbreviations, spelling and specific words, and formatting.</p>
<p>But first, find out how you can strengthen your understanding of style guides and good English.</p>
<h1><strong>What’s the difference between Chicago and AP?</strong></h1>
<p>These are two of the most popular style guides for professional writers. Since 1906, Chicago has been the go-to guide for literature. Some students use <em>Chicago</em> as well. In September 2017, Chicago issued its seventeenth edition.</p>
<p>The <em>AP Stylebook</em>, first published in 1953, is the bible for journalists. AP style focuses on saving space. Most web writing follows AP style.</p>
<p>The print version of the <em>AP Stylebook</em> is published every other spring. The last version was published in 2020, and the next version will be published in 2022. The digital format is updated more often.</p>
<p>In this post, you’ll see how <em>Chicago</em> compares with the most recent updates to AP style.</p>
<h1><strong>Guidelines versus rules</strong></h1>
<p>It’s important to note that these are style guides, not style rules. Consistency is the most important thing in any written piece. It’s also important to be consistent across a website or company. But in some cases, it’s appropriate to break a rule or use a less popular form, such as passive voice.</p>
<p>As a professional writer, you need to understand when it’s acceptable to break rules. Writing and editing aren’t like accounting. Pedantry won’t make you popular and may drive you crazy.</p>
<p>First, you should follow the requirements of your boss or client, even if you don’t always agree. It’s also best to follow any guidelines that were created to avoid offending readers.</p>
<p>You could never memorize a whole style guide, and you don’t want to follow each guideline obsessively. But your reference books will help you write in a consistent and educated way.</p>
<h1><strong>A word about web content</strong></h1>
<p>Reading web content makes learning proper English more challenging. Both US and world English are used online, and they’re different in terms of vocabulary, spelling, punctuation, and other aspects.</p>
<p>You’ll also see a great deal of writing by speakers of English as a second language. If these writers don’t seek editing by a native speaker of English, you’ll see errors and often a wordier approach.</p>
<p>Add to this the fact that many industries, companies, and brands use their own language. This includes not only jargon but also the “breaking” of certain established grammar rules.</p>
<p>If you’re a professional writer, you shouldn’t necessarily rely on other writers for your English education. Despite good editing and proofreading efforts, even professionally written news stories and printed books feature errors. What reading can do is show you how to craft interesting sentences and organize your own work into a cohesive and engaging piece.</p>
<p>So do familiarize yourself with the style guide that’s appropriate for the type of writing you do. When in doubt, consult your guide instead of blindly following somebody else’s writing.</p>
<p>And now, the comparison.</p>
<h1><strong>Punctuation</strong></h1>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>ITEM</strong></td>
<td><strong>CMOS 17</strong></td>
<td><strong>AP 2020 (updated 2021)</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Commas, general</strong></p>
<p>(Note: Instructions on the comma are lengthy in both CMOS and AP. Refer to your style guides for a full treatment of this punctuation mark.)</td>
<td>Use a serial comma in all instances for clarity.</p>
<p><em>The flag of Italy is green, white, and red.</em></td>
<td>Don’t use the serial comma in simple series.</p>
<p><em>The flag of Italy is green, white and red.</em></p>
<p>Use a serial comma where required for clarity and in complex series.</p>
<p><em>I like chicken salad, egg salad, and peanut butter and jelly.</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>etc. / and so forth / and the like</strong></td>
<td>A comma is no longer required after these terms except where needed grammatically.</p>
<p><em>The array of pies, cakes, cookies, etc. made my mouth water.</em></p>
<p>BUT</p>
<p><em>When it comes to pies, cakes, cookies, etc., I simply can’t resist.</em></td>
<td>AP states that although it’s traditional to use a comma afterward, it’s somewhat acceptable to skip the second comma.</p>
<p><em>The array of pies, cakes, cookies, etc., made my mouth water.</em></p>
<p>OR</p>
<p><em>The array of pies, cakes, cookies, etc. made my mouth water.</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>too / either</strong></td>
<td>No comma is necessary before either word if the word comes at the end of a sentence.</p>
<p><em>I like old movies too.</em></p>
<p><em>I don’t like old movies either.</em></td>
<td>Use commas only when required for clarity.</p>
<p><em>I like old movies too.</em></p>
<p>BUT</p>
<p><em>I don’t like old movies, either color or black and white.</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Participial or adverbial phrase plus conjunction</strong></td>
<td>The placement of the comma with a coordinating conjunction (and, but, or, etc.) varies depending on the sentence structure.</p>
<p>If the conjunction joins two independent clauses (complete sentences), the comma goes before the conjunction, as it would without the inserted phrase.</p>
<p><em>I was happy, but because I’d been up all night, I was also tired. (I was happy, but . . . I was also tired.)</em></p>
<p>If the words following the conjunction don’t form a complete sentence, the comma goes after the conjunction.</p>
<p><em>I was happy but, having stayed up all night, also tired.</em> <em>(I was happy but . . . also tired.)</em></td>
<td>No specific instructions; follow CMOS</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h1><strong>Capitalization</strong></h1>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>ITEM</strong></td>
<td><strong>CMOS 17</strong></td>
<td><strong>AP 2020 (updated 2021)</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Capitalization, general</strong></p>
<p>(Note: Instructions on capitalization are lengthy in both CMOS and AP. Refer to your style guides for a full treatment of capital letters.)</td>
<td></td>
<td>“In general, avoid unnecessary capitals.”</p>
<p>For example, there’s no reason to capitalize a spelled-out abbreviation unless it’s a proper noun.</p>
<p><em>World Health Organization (WHO)</em></p>
<p>BUT</p>
<p><em>computed tomography (CT) scan</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Mid-sentence, or interpolated, questions</strong></td>
<td>Capitalize a question that’s included in a sentence but doesn’t require quotation marks.</p>
<p><em>She thought, Is he serious?</em></td>
<td>Same as CMOS 17</p>
<p><em>She thought, Is he serious?</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Bulleted lists</strong></td>
<td>Items that aren’t full sentences may or may not be capitalized but be consistent.</td>
<td>Capitalize the first word in a bulleted list, whether the item is a full sentence or not. Close with a period in both cases as well. Note that true news stories use dashes instead of bullets; bullets are more common in web writing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Oxford shoes / Chelsea boots</strong></td>
<td>&#8212;</td>
<td>Capitalize the modifier.</p>
<p>BUT</p>
<p><em>french fries</em> (French is a cut, not a nationality, here.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Generation X / Generation Y / Generation Z</strong></td>
<td>Use an uppercase <em>G</em>.</td>
<td>Use an uppercase <em>G</em>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Romantic / Romanticism</strong></td>
<td>Use an uppercase <em>R</em>.</td>
<td><em>romantic</em></p>
<p>BUT</p>
<p><em>Romanticism</em> and <em>Romantic Movement</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>internet</strong></td>
<td>Lowercase is now standard.</td>
<td><em>internet</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Unusual capitalization of company names, brand names, and trademarks</strong></td>
<td>Retain the organization’s preferred capitalization, even at the beginning of a sentence. The exception is if the name is in all lowercase letters. In this case, capitalize the word to distinguish it as a proper noun.</p>
<p><em>eBay is a great place to find bargains.</em></p>
<p><em>I publish my blog on WordPress.</em></p>
<p>BUT</p>
<p><em>This store sells Asap skincare.</em> (Stylized by the brand as <em>asap</em>)</td>
<td>Capitalize brand names when they’re used. No other specific guidelines are given, but it’s best to follow Chicago’s rule on capitalizing all-lowercase names for clarity.</td>
</tr>

<h1><strong>Numbers</strong></h1>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>ITEM</strong></td>
<td><strong>CMOS 17</strong></td>
<td><strong>AP 2020 (updated 2021)</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Numbers, general</strong></p>
<p>(Note: Instructions on numbers are lengthy in both CMOS and AP. Refer to your style guides for a full treatment of numbers.)</td>
<td>Chicago’s general rule is to spell out “zero” through “one hundred.” Large round numbers are also written out.</p>
<p><em>My neighbor has two cars.</em></p>
<p><em>I saw ninety-nine red balloons.</em></p>
<p><em>There were eighty thousand people at the protest.</em></p>
<p>BUT</p>

<td>AP recommends the second example only.</p>
<p><em>Please call 1-800-555-1212.</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Twenty-four-hour, or military, time</strong></td>
<td>A colon may be used for clarity.</p>
<p><em>The mess hall opens at 0500.</em></p>
<p>BUT</p>
<p><em>The history program started at 19:00.</em></td>
<td>No guidelines on colon usage.</p>
<p><em>The mess hall opens at 0500.</em></p>
<p>AND</p>
<p><em>The history program started at 1900.</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Super Bowl</strong></td>
<td>No specific reference, but CMOS does state a general preference for Arabic numerals over Roman.</td>
<td>Don’t use Roman numerals. Preferably, use the year instead of the number.</p>
<p><em>The New York Giants won the 1987 Super Bowl.</em></p>
<p>ALSO ACCEPTABLE:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Aspiring writers often have quite a few questions wondering if they are doing everything correctly. Should they sign up for some sort of class on writing to get experience? Do they need a mentor that will guide them along the way? Is it true they have to starve first by giving up their job so they can focus on only writing? But the truth of the matter is, what may work for one writer may not work for another.</p>
<p>The most difficult thing facing an aspiring writer is to take time out of each and every day to practice their craft. In truth, you are either an aspiring writer or a writer. If all you do is talk about wanting to write a book, then you are an aspiring writer. If you are actively writing each and every week, then you are already a writer! When it comes down to it, aspiring writers talk the talk, but writers walk the walk.</p>
<p>Which leads to one of the most asked questions by writers or aspiring writers. How much should I write every day? There is such a thing as quality over quantity though. But by realizing the daily word count that successful writers write, it should provide a good estimate on what you should be achieving. And I am speaking about the daily word count for the book that you are writing, not anything else.</p>
<p>Many people, unfortunately, write thousands of words on their social media accounts during the day. They write about their daily schedule, what they had to eat recently, or their personal views on the most recent topics. If you are truly a writer, do yourself a favor and stay off of social media as much as you can and focus on your writing project. When you finally complete your book, I guarantee that you will not say to yourself, “I sure wish I would have posted more on Facebook instead to keep everyone up to date on the mundane things of my life.”</p>
<p><strong>Daily Word Counts</strong><br />
As you will notice from reading the list below, daily word counts vary greatly from one successful writer to the next. In addition, these are all authors that make their living by writing. They don’t have a forty hour a week job to go to either. But if you have been writing for awhile now and know your approximate daily word count, it might compare quite favorably with these famous authors!</p>
<h2>Ernest Hemingway: 500 Words</h2>
<p>Of course, Hemingway is no longer alive, but when he was he would stick around writing about 500 words a day. “When I am working on a book or a story I write every morning as soon after first light as possible. You have started at six in the morning, say, and may go on until noon or be through before that,” Hemingway said.</p>
<h2>Stephen King: 2,000 Words</h2>
<p>Stephen King seems to be one of the most prolific writers of all time. His novels can be extremely long and wordy, so one would think he would write an immense amount of words daily. However, this is not always the case.</p>
<p>In his book On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft, King speaks on his writing speed. He would set a daily goal of about 2,000 words. This would add up to about 180,000 words in three months of writing. He also said that three months was the maximum amount of time it should take someone to finish a first draft. If it takes longer, it will get tougher and tougher to delve back into the story with the right frame of mind. In addition, King can often become involved in marathon writing sessions. He wrote The Running Man in one week.</p>
<h2>Jack London: 1,500 Words</h2>
<p>Jack London’s most well known novel, The Call of the Wild, was a classic. He probably had a few more in him, but he died at the age of forty. “You can’t wait for inspiration. You have to go after it with a club,” he stated.</p>
<h2>Tom Wolfe: 135 Words</h2>
<p>Tom Wolfe is an author that has written many popular books that were later made into films. The Right Stuff and The Bonfire of the Vanities are just a couple. However, he never seemed to be in a rush to finish his books. His book A Man in Full is 370,000 words and it took him eleven years to finish. “My children grew up thinking that was all I did: write, and never finish, a book called A Man in Full,” Wolfe admitted.</p>
<h2>Mark Twain: 1,400-1,800 Words</h2>
<p>If there was a Mount Rushmore for writers, Mark Twain would definitely be on it. But he realized that sometime it depended on the location of where you are actually doing the writing. “In 1897, when we were living in Tedworth Square, London, and I was writing the book called “Following the Equator” my average was eighteen hundred words a day; here in Florence, (1904), my average seems to be fourteen hundred words per sitting of four or five hours.”</p>
<h2>W. Somerset Maugham: 1,000 Words</h2>
<p>W. Somerset Maugham was a British playwright, novelist, and short story author. He was among the most popular writers of his era and was also reportedly the highest-paid author during the 1930s. He was an orphan by the time he turned ten years old and was raised by an uncle that did his best to make into an accountant. Maugham persevered through life and wrote some quality classics. But he even recognized there was no set formula on writing. “There are three rules for writing a novel,” he said. “Unfortunately, no one knows what they are.”</p>
<h2>Sarah Waters: 1,000 Words</h2>
<p>Sarah Waters is a Welsh novelist and bestselling author. She has written six novels to date with many of them being turned into films. Still, she feels the same way a lot of writers do when sitting down to write everyday. “My minimum is 1,000 words a day… Those 1,000 words might well be rubbish- they often are. But then, it is always easier to return to rubbish words at a later date and make them better,” Waters said.</p>
<h2>Sebastian Faulks: 1,000 Words</h2>
<p>Sebastian Faulks is a British novelist, journalist, and broadcaster. He is perhaps best known for his historical novels that are set in France. Faulks believes in consistency when working. “When I am writing a book I write from ten til six everyday in a small office near my house,” he said. “I never write less than a 1000 words a day. Writer’s Block is God’s way of telling you to shut up. More people should have it.”</p>
<h2>Michael Crichton: 10,000 Words</h2>
<p>Michael Crichton wrote several novels that were later turned into films. Jurassic Park was just one of the popular ones. Crichton passed away almost ten years ago, but he was an American author, screenwriter, film director, and producer that did very well in the genres of science fiction and thrillers. Also, his daily word count was always extremely high. “Books aren&#8217;t written &#8211; they&#8217;re rewritten,” he said. “Including your own. It is one of the hardest things to accept, especially after the seventh rewrite hasn&#8217;t quite done it.”</p>
<h2>Kate DiCamillo: 600-900 Words</h2>
<p>Kate DiCamillo is an American writer of children&#8217;s fiction that has written several modern day classics. Because of Winn-Dixie, The Tale of Despereaux, and Flora &amp; Ulysses are merely a few. She is also one of six people to win two Newbery Medals recognizing her work. &#8220;My goal is two pages a day, five days a week. I never want to write, but I&#8217;m always glad that I have done it,” DiCamillo said. I think many writers know exactly what she means by this.</p>
<h2>Nicholas Sparks: 2,000 Words</h2>
<p>Nicholas Sparks is an American romance novelist, screenwriter, and producer. His books and films all follow a bit of the same pattern with a woman meeting a new man, and the women that read his books and watch his movies just love it. He has published nineteen novels to date. Sparks says a novel takes him a few months to conceive, and then about five months to write. He sets a daily goal for himself of 2,000 words which takes him about five to six hours to write. “See,” he said, “it’s not an unbelievable pace.”</p>
<h2>J.G. Ballard: 1,000 Words</h2>
<p>James Ballard was an English novelist and short story writer who passed away in 2009. He said, “All through my career I’ve written 1,000 words a day- even if I’ve got a hangover. You’ve got to discipline yourself if you’re professional. There’s no other way.”</p>
<h2>Ian McEwan: 600 Words</h2>
<p>Ian McEwan is an English novelist and screenwriter that has attained the recognition that most writers dream about. In 2008, The Times featured him on their list of &#8220;The 50 greatest British writers since 1945&#8221; and The Daily Telegraph ranked him number 19 in their list of the &#8220;100 most powerful people in British culture&#8221;. Not too shabby. “I aim for about six hundred words a day and hope for at least a thousand when I’m on a roll,” he once said.</p>
<h2>Lee Child: 1,800 Words</h2>
<p>Lee Child is a British author who is best known for his Jack Reacher novels that have been made into films starring Tom Cruise. “I write in the afternoon, from about 12 until about 6 or 7,” he said. “I use an upstairs room as my office. Once I get going I keep at it, and it usually takes about six months from the first blank screen until the end.”</p>
<h2>Anne Rice: 3,000 Words</h2>
<p>Anne Rice is an American author from New Orleans that writes quite a bit of gothic fiction. She is best known for her vampire novels and the film Interview with a Vampire. “I have to get all distractions out of the way,” she says. “I plunge into the work and write an episode; I can’t just clock in at 3,000 words. I have to have time free to resolve things. I write in episodic ways. But when I’m ready to plunge in, I write from late morning through all afternoon, all evening.”</p>
<h2>Arthur Conan Doyle: 3,000 Words</h2>
<p>Arthur Conan Doyle is best known for his novels starring Sherlock Holmes, probably the most popular fictional detective of all time. He wrote sixty stories about the legendary sleuth. “Anything is better than stagnation,” he said.</p>
<h2>Arthur Hailey: 600 Words</h2>
<p>Arthur Hailey died in 2004, but before his time was up he had written many novels that had a backdrop of several industries. One of his more popular ones that was later made into a movie was Airport. “I set myself 600 words a day as a minimum output, regardless of the weather, my state of mind or if I’m sick or well,” he had said. “There must be 600 finished words- not almost right words.”</p>
<h2>Graham Greene: 500 Words</h2>
<p>Graham Greene was an English novelist regarded by many as one of the great writers of the 20th century. He wrote highly acclaimed serious Catholic novels and thrillers. Greene came close to winning the Nobel Prize for Literature in back to back years in 1966 and 1967. He passed away in 1991, but through his 67 years of writing he had completed 25 novels. “Over twenty years I have probably averaged five hundred words a day for five days a week. I can produce a novel in a year, and that allows time for revision and the correction of the typescript. I have always been very methodical, and when my quota of work is done I break off, even in the middle of a scene,” he said.</p>
<h2>Holly Black: 1,000 Words</h2>
<p>Holly Black is an American writer best known for The Spiderwick Chronicles, a series of children&#8217;s fantasy books she created with writer and illustrator Tony DiTerlizzi. She also has written a trilogy of young adult novels officially called the Modern Faerie Tales trilogy. Black perhaps summarizes the feeling of every writer when she responded back to a compliment about how productive she has been with all her novels. “First of all, thank you very much for saying I’m productive, because some days I don’t feel that way,” she said. “Yes, I try to write a thousand words every day. I’ve actually put up my daily word counts online for my last several novels. I do this to keep myself honest, saying exactly when I wrote what part of the book. Certainly the comment I most often get is, “That’s not really a lot of words,” but it goes to show that just steadily working will get you a book. I try to make a thousand words a day, but that isn’t always the reality.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As writers, we all have that place in our house where we tend to be more creative and the words just come a little easier for us. If you are serious about writing as a career or even a side job, it&#8217;s extremely important to find this place. It doesn&#8217;t have to be anything fancy. Just somewhere that you can think and go about practicing your craft without interruption or intrusion. I find that people tend to impede my writing if I am just sitting on the couch and typing away. They may think that they are only interrupting me for a second, but they may be putting a halt to a flood of creativity that was just about ready to pour through me. And this is just as much my fault as theirs, as I should be in my <strong>Do Not Disturb</strong> spot while working.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t have a perfect spot in your house to do your writing in, now is the time to create one. In the film Funny Farm, one of Chevy Chase&#8217;s last good ones, he plays a sports writer that moves out into the country in Redbud, Vermont with his wife so he can write the next great american novel. Chase&#8217;s character is excited about a room upstairs with a gorgeous view that will be perfect for him to write in. But soon, there are constant interruptions and he can&#8217;t write anything substantial. The birds outside his window are driving him crazy. The maniacal mailman is disturbing him enough that he often stops writing completely so he can get his mail and some revenge. They find a body buried in their yard. He starts to go fishing instead of working. And then, he finally gives up on his dream of writing that novel that he has been talking about for years. Don&#8217;t let this happen to you. Draw some inspiration from the writing spaces that successful authors have constructed for themselves. You might even be surprised that some very famous authors choose to write outside their house instead!</p>
<h2>1. Charles Dickens</h2>
<p>British novelist Charles Dickens was born on February 7, 1812, in Portsmouth, England. Over the course of his entire writing career, he wrote the forever classic novels Oliver Twist, A Christmas Carol, Nicholas Nickleby, David Copperfield, A Tale of Two Cities and Great Expectations. This is quite a resume of beloved books. For most of them, Dickens would insist on writing at his familiar desk and chair. He felt he did his best work at his beloved desk, and would often have it shipped with him when he knew he would be gone awhile from home. If you are interested in seeing the desk and chair in person, they are on display at the Charles Dickens Museum at the author&#8217;s former home in London.</p>
<h2>2. Virginia Woolf</h2>
<p>Adeline Virginia Woolf was an English writer born in 1882 who is considered one of the foremost modernists of the twentieth century. She is best known for her novels Mrs. Dalloway (1925) and To the Lighthouse (1927). Every morning she would walk down to the basement and into a storage room with a cozy old armchair that she loved. She would write away sitting in the armchair in her peace and quiet.</p>
<h2>3. Agatha Christie</h2>
<p>Agatha Christie was born Agatha Mary Clarissa Miller on September 15, 1890 in the southwest part of England. The youngest of three children, she was educated at home by her mother who would always encourage her daughter to write. Christie was an author who would churn out classical detective stories at an astounding rate. In fact, she is tied with William Shakespeare as the best selling fiction author of all time. Where did Christie conceive all of her masterpieces? She most often would be sitting in her large Victorian bathtub eating apples as the created the plots to her novels.</p>
<h2>4. Edith Wharton</h2>
<p>Edith Newbold Jones was born into a wealthy New York family, and later in life married a rich banker named Edward Wharton in 1885. After her marriage ended in divorce in 1913, she began to write stories set among turn-of-the-century New York society. She did not have her first novel published until the age of 40. This did not slow her down though, she eventually wrote 38 books. The most well known book was the Pulitzer Prize winner The Age of Innocence. Most mornings, she would write while still covered up in bed. It was her preferred spot. She would have her dog on one side of her, and an ink bottle on the other. Her secretary would later type up all the pages she had written by hand.</p>
<h2>5. Stephen King</h2>
<p>Before Stephen King became recognized as one of the best horror writers of all time, he was a struggling English teacher living out of a trailer with his wife Tabitha. She worked at Dunkin&#8217; Donuts on the second shift. King couldn&#8217;t even afford his own typewriter, so he used his wife&#8217;s as he worked at his makeshift desk that was sandwiched between the washing machine and the dryer. He would literally lock himself in the laundry room to do his writing. It was there that he created his first hit novel Carrie. It just goes to show you, you do not need a fancy spot to complete your writing in. You just need a location that is suitable for you!</p>
<h2>6. E.B. White</h2>
<p>E.B. White is best known for writing his book Charlotte&#8217;s Web. Everyone loved that little runt Wilbur and the spider Charlotte. White did not believe in picking out the quietest spot to write. He would most often work in his living room as the bustle of life went on around him. He would say that his family never bothered to be quiet as he wrote, they would continue acting as if he wasn&#8217;t even around. He once said,  &#8220;A writer who waits for ideal conditions under which to work will die without putting a word on paper.&#8221; Perhaps you write in a similar environment?</p>
<h2>7. Ernest Hemingway</h2>
<p>Every serious writer knows who Ernest Hemingway was because he was definitely a like-minded individual. He took his craft seriously. He was well known for novels like The Sun Also Rises, A Farewell to Arms, For Whom the Bell Tolls, and The Old Man and the Sea. In 1954, Hemingway even won the Nobel Prize. He committed suicide on July 2, 1961, in Ketchum, Idaho. He never had a set place where he liked to write, but he did have a time of the day that he favored. Hemingway would often write as soon as it first became light in the morning. He cherished the quietness and the chill in the air. He would usually try to write for six hours a day, and then stop and wait until the next morning where he could continue on with his craft.</p>
<h2>8. Mark Twain</h2>
<p>Mark Twain had a private study built separate from his house so he could be secluded while writing and also smoke his cigars that his wife hated. Best known for The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876) and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1885), Twain was a living legend back in his day. He followed his routine for writing almost every day. He would go to his study after having a large breakfast. Once there, he would skip lunch and work without interruption until almost five at night. If the family needed him for anything at the house, they would blow a loud horn and he would come.</p>
