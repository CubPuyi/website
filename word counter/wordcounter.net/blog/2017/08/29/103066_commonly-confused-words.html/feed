					<description><![CDATA[These are quite common mistakes and often people make them not because of illiteracy but rather because of inattention.  
I got B- grade for one of my essays because I didn&#039;t edit &#039;Than&#039; for &#039;Then&#039; (or the contrary). And since then I have been checking my texts very carefully.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordcounter.net/blog/2017/08/29/103066_commonly-confused-words.html#comments/42159&quot;&gt;Kandyce&lt;/a&gt;.

I think it&#039;s amazing that there was an example of a commonly confused word inside an article about the same mistakes, good job catching that!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So, while I wholly agree with these proscribed uses of &quot;literally&quot;, I actually disagree with the prescribed use. &quot;Literally&quot; should be reserved for statements in which the expression is normally a figure of speech or could reasonably be taken as one. I recognize this as a somewhat stylistic claim, not to be defended on etymology or accepted use alone. I believe, though, that the claim stands on some objective grounds in that in all other cases a more apt term would serve (actually, astonishingly, or — in this case — ironically). In the statement, &quot;The Titanic, the supposed unsinkable ship, literally sank on its first voyage.&quot; use of the word &quot;literally&quot; adds no content.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Error above:   Never, never, never use &quot;went&quot; after has, had, have, any form of be, etc... !  
Your example -- 
&quot;WRONG:  I should of went to the store today.
CORRECT: I should’ve went to the store today.&quot;
Correct = I should&#039;ve GONE to the store today.]]></description>
