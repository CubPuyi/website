I have watched my twin finish entire novels he purchased in 4 hours. I read a novel 3 hours before a university exam and was the only student in my class to actually answer the essay for a 4.0 score. We both prefer chapters in the 8-10k range because we read at such a speed that we almost experience the books as movies. I also tend to write 10k chapters. I will generally go through 6 to 7 chapters of mine in a single night while proofreading and modifying the flow. Moral of the story, write however big you are comfortable, y&#039;know.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So your argument for chapter length is based off of a book designed to hold a child&#039;s attention span...

There’s nothing wrong with longer chapters either. I read around half a book before bedtime sometimes the entire thing (sleep? What sleep?), so maybe I’m not the best person to ask though…]]></description>

Chapter length doesn’t matter as much as the actual novel length and, you know, a good story does. I’m sure that an editor can help you rearrange your chapters so that they’re better if you’re really worried about it. Check out the great editors at reedsy.com.]]></description>

As a reader, I must say that I dislike fantasy novels that aren’t long enough, seeing that I bought a book and it was over before I opened it. Your chapter length is fine, but decent YA fantasy is at least 90,000 words, really.]]></description>
