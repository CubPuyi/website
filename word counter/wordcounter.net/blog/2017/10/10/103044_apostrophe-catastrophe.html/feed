I don&#039;t add an apostrophe unless omitting one could cause the reader to confuse your pluralized word with another word. So I too would write &quot;ifs, ands, and buts,&quot; but here are two exceptions:

- I use &quot;A&#039;s and B&#039;s&quot; for grades instead of &quot;As and Bs&quot; because the reader could confuse &quot;As&quot; (plural) with the word &quot;as.&quot;
- I write &quot;do&#039;s and don&#039;t&#039;s&quot; because &quot;dos&quot; without an apostrophe could be read as either misspelling &quot;does&quot; or sloppily rendering the operating system DOS.

This rule is supported by Lynne Truss, the brilliant author of &quot;Eats, Shoots &#038; Leaves.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordcounter.net/blog/2017/10/10/103044_apostrophe-catastrophe.html#comments/42965&quot;&gt;Claire&lt;/a&gt;.

It&#039;s keen to use an apostrophe to pluralize other parts of language (other than nouns) that wouldn&#039;t habitually have a plural form. This would be for acronyms, singular letters (which would have to be capitalized to determine that the letter is being pluralized), and non-noun words. One might keep in mind that present participles (verbs ending in -ing) and past participles [verbs formed with the ending of -ed or those employed in the perfect mood (i.e. I have eaten)]. Thus being said, an example of using an apostrophe to pluralize an acronym is as follows. 
            &quot;The army had a lot of MIA&#039;s last year.&quot; 
Rather than saying &quot;MIA soldiers&quot;, the adjective is taking the place of a noun—which is known as linguistical normalization. &quot;If&quot;, &quot;and&quot;, and &quot;but&quot; aren&#039;t nouns, they&#039;re contractions. Thereof, in order to pluralize them, you must (to be poshly correct) employ an apostrophe, diverging from the article&#039;s stated use situations of one&#039;s use. 
I hope this helps!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just read a grammar book that stated that you needed to use an apostrophe for things like ifs, ands, and buts. Clearly (since I didn&#039;t use one), I wholly disagree. It makes no sense since those are not possessive or contractions; nor are they missing any letters. Thoughts on a rule like this? I inked it out on my students&#039; papers.]]></description>
