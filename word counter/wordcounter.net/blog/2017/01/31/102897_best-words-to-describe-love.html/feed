Hi Alita. I was hoping that you might be able to offer me some ideas and/or a poem. I would like to give my ex-husband a card with a note letting him know how much he is appreciated. We have 2 young boys together. He is a wonderful loving and compassionate father and while we are no longer together we are still great friends. He is going through a bit of a low point and I would like to remind him that he is doing a wonderful job. He is an artist and naturally a very creative and passionate individual. Thank you in advance for any suggestions that you may have to share.]]></description>

Hi Christine. We have been sharing exactly, nearly word for word, our definition of what love is! I just thought I&#039;d let you know. I appreciate you putting it &quot;out there&quot; so that way everyone can hear it.

					<description><![CDATA[Love is going out in the middle of the night looking for your daughter who is an addict.  Love is feeling immobile under your childhood quilt because if your husband‚Äôs infidelity.  Love is crying and laughing at the same time because your granddaughter just made her arrival into this crazy world. And love is putting on the bravest act as if you were in battle holding your mother who is dying fro cancer and she wants to hear you singing a lullaby to her.]]></description>
