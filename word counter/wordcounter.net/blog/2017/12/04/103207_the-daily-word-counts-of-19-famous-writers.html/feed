Coming in late, but you&#039;re 16 now! Definitely old enough to write a novel if you so wished!]]></description>

i&#039;m also a young, aspiring writer, as the comments all are. i love this. may i continue? 


I prefer to abstain from such things as hatred. Spiteful, bitter emotion, is the strongest of the rest. It can compel you to do such terrible things. Of course, the most terrible things are often perceived as, simply put, not. Humans often have hazy recallings of events, which I do not participate in. The events in which I am referring to, as well as the hazy recallings. I am a firm believer in recallings, please do not misconstrue my words, however, I must let some words escape my lips, words that aren&#039;t a secret. These words, though, do have an underlying secretive tone when you speak them. Forget everything I&#039;ve told you, hazy recallings do not exist. Oh, how I wish they did, for they would be a tangible excuse, that you do not recall. In this scenario, I condone lying, saying you do not recall. If that memory was crammed in the smallest corner of your brain, you would still be able to recall. Effort is all it takes, yet another thing humans have hatred for. Go on, lie, hate, be compelled, do not recall. Even if there is no being above us all, tallying each of your actions, what is to say there is not one with us?]]></description>

I WANT TO BE YOU!!! I&#039;m twelve, but I&#039;m too ashamed to show my writings to my parents. My friends have read fanfiction I&#039;ve done, but that&#039;s about it. Complete stranger, I am so proud of you. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f643.png" alt="🙃" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Once again, as pointed out by everyone in the comments, I’m a young, aspiring “author”. I’ve really got no clue what else to say, so yeah. And yes, I’m aware it’s “pretentious” and people might get “society” vibes but, idc.
 Here:The cold porcelain bit and gnawed at my back, the water, now after 2 hours of soaking, was in the same frigid state of being. I would’ve noted the estranged murky state of the water, although, in that given moment the only thing that one may deem worthy of a source of light was the pile of several dozen smothered cigarettes, or the one currently hanging off my lip. On several occasions, they all simmered down in miraculous unison, and, after an indiscernible quantity of time, would flash in a seeming hatred and fury. At what, I’ve no clue.]]></description>

I&#039;ve been writing for a long time now. I never finished the story but I&#039;ve written lots of short stories and fan fictions. I&#039;ve shared my stories with a few friends and family and I&#039;m always encouraged to continue what I&#039;m doing.
Thank you for these amazing words. It&#039;s been a long time since I&#039;ve been on here to do something besides look at the word count for something. I forgot how much this website helped me when I was younger.
Thanks again, Nancy. These are some of the most encouraging words I&#039;ve ever received. I also wish you luck with your writing.]]></description>
