					<description><![CDATA[Is someone asks you to help them and you don&#039;t want to, don&#039;t. There is nothing that says you have to say yes. If you want to help, go ahead, and if you don&#039;t, say no. It&#039;s really not that difficult.]]></description>

Yes! Not just writers, but for any profession where people may ask for your help. It&#039;s important to value your time and to not give it away for free or people will take advantage of you time and time again. This often happens to me with computers and my wife with writing.]]></description>

I think there is a difference between helping writers and them asking you to do the work for them. I see a big difference between the two.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Am I the only one that doesn&#039;t mind helping out new writers? I have no problem going over their work and helping them find contacts. I was once in their position and I wish there was somebody who would have helped me out, so I just don&#039;t have an issue with any of these things. Writing isn&#039;t all about &quot;you&quot; -- it&#039;s something to be shared and nurtured.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As the writer, I get asked a lot to help want to be writers. Often these requests are to help them out without getting paid for it. When I first started, I used to do this, but I don&#039;t anymore. As a writer, my time is valuable. If I&#039;m doing other things in writing, then that means I have less time to write.

My solution, and the solution that I think every writer should do, is to put a price on an hour of their time. That&#039;s what you charge. If a person isn&#039;t willing to pay that, then they really don&#039;t value your expertise. Writing is a business and if you&#039;re giving your time away for free to help others, you&#039;re not being a businessperson.]]></description>

This is some great advice. Writing takes so much time and effort and I don&#039;t think others appreciate this. Your time isn&#039;t free and if others think it should be, then they don&#039;t understand what it takes to be a successful writer.]]></description>
