Every writer is different and may want something that the next writer doesn&#039;t. The worst thing you can do is assume what they want. If you aren&#039;t willing to ask, at least pay attention when they talk about their writing. Chances are they will indirectly tell you want they want/need.]]></description>

Along the same lines, give them the gift of a writers&#039; retreat. This will give them a block of several days to write in peace and quiet.]]></description>

My guess is that in the near future, Amazon will begin to buy publishing houses. Before you think this is ridiculous, look at Netflix and how they now produce their own content. It makes sense that Amazon would do the same thing.]]></description>

On this line of thought, buying a writer a writer&#039;s retreat is a great gift. There is nothing writers love more than a block of time to get away from everything else and just write to their heart&#039;s content.]]></description>

This is the best advice in the comment section, Ask. It&#039;s far better to know what the writer wants than to try and guess what he or she might want. I&#039;ve never understood why people have such a difficult time asking  writers what they need or want. Most have a long list they are more than willing to share.]]></description>
