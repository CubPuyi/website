It&#039;s time to get new friends. Truly, if your friends don&#039;t support you in the things you want to do, then are they really friends? A great place to get support for your writing is to join a writer&#039;s group in your area. It will help a lot and give a lot of positive reinforcement to your writing.]]></description>

&quot;Oh and at least on fanfiction, no one really trolls the little guy, so smile when someone’s giving you crap for no reason.&quot;

This is what stood out when I read your reply. If people start critiquing your fanfiction, that means you&#039;re doing something right. You&#039;ve reach the point where someones feels it&#039;s relevant enough to comment on it which is a huge step above silence.]]></description>

Too many critics try to make the criticism personal and as soon as they do that, any criticism becomes moot no matter how relevant it may be. As you said, critic the work, not the person. Too many aren&#039;t able to distinguish the difference.]]></description>

hahaha -- if I got an email like this, I would assume it was a scam as well. Why would anyone give their credit card details to a complete stranger? That&#039;s not criticism of your writing skills, that&#039;s just plain common sense]]></description>

This is so important. Criticism can be valid even if you don&#039;t like it. If you refuse to accept valid criticism, you are only hurting yourself and your writing will never get better. If you aren&#039;t willing to listen to criticism at all, you shouldn&#039;t be a writer because no matter how good of a writer you are, you can always get better.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I want to be a writer, but everyone always tells me that my writing isn&#039;t good enough. It&#039;s so discouraging. They say that I should try and get a job doing something that&#039;s more stable. The thing is, I don&#039;t want to do something else. I want to be a writer. That&#039;s my dream, but it&#039;s so discouraging when everybody else tells you that you should do something other than your dream. How do I get rid of this negativity so that I can continue to pursue what I want to?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One more thing I would like to add about criticism of any kind: Whether you are dishing it out to your just-can&#039;t-remember-to-put-the-seat-down boyfriend, or writing a professional book review, do not criticize the PERSON. Criticize the ACTION or lack thereof - I read a review on Amazon today that was all &quot;The author is really stupid to...&quot; &quot;The author must be a real b%*&#038;^ . . . &quot; - that&#039;s not helping anyone, and the only person who looks like  B%*&#038;^ is the person writing the review.

This is a wonderful blog post, as are all the posts I have come across on this blog - please keep up the good work, Jennifer! It was also great to see a critic get in on the discussion - and I sincerely appreciate both his input and his willingness to help those willing to accept true, professional criticism (which is by definition constructive) as an opportunity to learn and improve your craft. And that is indeed the exact opportunity we should actively be seeking out, and for which we should always be grateful.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great tips! I think it&#039;s important not to lose heart when you receive negative criticism. Everybody likes different things, and I&#039;m sure there are a lot of people out there who don&#039;t think that Hemingway or Steinbeck are that good of writers or care for their work. Good thing those guys didn&#039;t give up!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a critic, and I actually agree with you. When someone gets overly defensive and angry over my simply telling what I see, I tend to pass that person off as immature, I certainly never deal with them again.

Now when someone confronts me on it maturely, asks for advice or help, or even pulls out just the acceptance card? That brings a smile to my face. I&#039;m more than willing to waste a few hours of my time helping them past that problem, explaining in detail what normally causes the problem and giving examples as to how they can work on it. I&#039;ve even made quite a few friends that way.

Basically, you need to realize the difference between a troll, a critic, and an bully. A critic sees a problem and writes it down in detail. A troll makes a problem or senses an insecurity and focuses in on it with the intention of hurting you.
A bully wants nothing more than to hurt you, most of the time because it makes them feel better.

I understand that professional writing is a lot different from fanfiction but the general idea is still there. Analyze the criticism, dig deep and see if you can get anything out of it. If you can&#039;t, maybe it isn&#039;t true. If you can, use it to your advantage. Feeling sorry for yourself or defensive creates stasis. Everyone has a contact who can give them advice, so if you&#039;re confused bring it to them. Maybe they can help.

Oh and at least on fanfiction, no one really trolls the little guy, so smile when someone&#039;s giving you crap for no reason.]]></description>
