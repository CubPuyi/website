You won&#039;t even notice the improvements, but you&#039;ll look at your writing in a year and be amazed at how much better you are now than you were then.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Writing skills are so valuable these days in business. It&#039;s surprising the number of people who don&#039;t know how to write well. I mean just basic, decent writing. Being able to do that is enough to get you a job in many cases because so many people can&#039;t even do that these days.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great list! I rely on a few things listed here.

For instance, I do outlining all the time. It helps me organize my scattered thoughts! :)

I don&#039;t rely on auto spelling/grammar checkers. I personally take the time to check my work each and every time.  I sometimes rewrite some of my old work too.

An online dictionary is a very handy tool to expand vocabulary, so we are not surprised to see it in the above list!]]></description>
