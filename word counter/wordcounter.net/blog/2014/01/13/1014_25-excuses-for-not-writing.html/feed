					<description><![CDATA[Well, some people ARE busy, and do not have time. I DO prioritise my things. The list goes like this:
1. My health
2. School
3. Friends and family
4. Theatre
5. Writing
6. Reading
7. Watching musicals
8. Anything else

If I have school, have rehearsal right after, and want to spend time with my sister after dinner, I DO NOT have time! 

So my tip would be: remember to put your health and happiness first. All the other things can wait. Even writing if it doesn&#039;t make you happy anymore.]]></description>
