					<description><![CDATA[I love traveling and traveling makes you create unique ideas for your writing. You encounter a lot of people and this one helps you create an idea in your mind to write on your topic. I also watch movies, by watching movies it helps you open your brain to a lot of ideas and possibilities you can add it in your writing.

Thank you for posting this one. Cheers!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Excellent list of ideas. 

It all boils down to the topics that you write about. The more general your topic of interest is, the easier for you to write and the wider the choices.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not sure what the point of this story is. It&#039;s pretty generalized and commonsense, no?

If you&#039;re suggesting inspiration for writing for a living,  then casting about for random interesting things to write about is going about it the wrong way. If you&#039;re interested in writing for a specific publication, website or other outlet, then you need to study that website/publication to get an understanding of what types of writing they typically publish. What are the topics, what&#039;s the typical length. Study the writing style of the various authors. By doing this you&#039;ll have a more accurate idea of what a given publication is looking for rather than randomly proposing some topic out of the blue. Pick up The Writer&#039;s Market or another annually updated resource for writers that consolidates information on thousands of possible outlets for writers. Professional writers don&#039;t just write about things they think up. They do actual research on a given topic so they can truly add value to the content they&#039;re creating.]]></description>
