Word of mouth works well if you are an extrovert and have a lot of acquaintances to get the ball rolling. if you tend to keep to yourself and aren&#039;t that outgoing, it&#039;s more difficult to take advantage of this way to promote your writing. Still, you should promote it as many different ways as you can to find what&#039;s the most successful way for you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Don&#039;t forget good old word of mouth. If you write things that people want to share with others, they will pass it on to others. Find those who like to share the good books that they have read and it can be a great way to promote your writing.]]></description>

This is so true. Once your book is finished, that&#039;s where the real work begins. There are so many aspects that going into being a successful writer that have nothing to do with sitting down in front of a computer and cranking out words. This is something that many aspiring writers don&#039;t understand.]]></description>

Promoting my work is the most difficult part of being a writer for me. It&#039;s not writing the book, editing the book or anything that typically is considered difficult. Promotion is what gets me because I&#039;m an introvert at heart. This list is quite helpful for someone like me to find ways to promote that don&#039;t mean I have to be an extrovert in the process.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As a published writer, the one thing that they never tell you when you start off is the amount of promotion that you need to do. Writing is only half the battle. It&#039;s probably even less than half the battle. If you want to be a successful writer, you need to be a successful promoter. If you don&#039;t want to promote your writing, you&#039;re going to have a hard time becoming a successful writer.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well done - This is (as usual) an outstanding post, and I was really stoked to find some ideas on here that were different yet pragmatic and atten-grabbing without looking like you&#039;re a ridiculous eccentric  using gimmicky shameless self-promotion. And I love that many of these can be extrapolated for creative projects other than a book. Thanks again, Jennifer. I love this blog.]]></description>
