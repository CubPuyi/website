Don&#039;t try to start writing it all at once. Choose a number that is a bit lower. When you consistently meet that on a daily basis, set the goal a little higher. It takes practice to hit 1000 words a day and doesn&#039;t happen overnight. If you set out to do it step by step with small weekly improvements, you should be able to eventually reach your 1000 words a day goal.]]></description>

Always do your research. So many posts out there today make no sense or do not grab your attention while reading, so make sure to do your research before posting on a subject. Also make sure to make it fun to read that will attract more people.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think when it comes to blogging you need to make it a habit and actually post quite frequently. Then again, also not too much. You have to find that happy medium. Choose a set time of day that you can stick to and post daily or even twice a day.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I appreciate you writing about this topic. There are a lot of times it&#039;s difficult for me to stay motivated and write as much as I want/need to write. It&#039;s a constant struggle and I&#039;m always looking for new suggestions on how to increase my productivity. Thank you for the tips.

					<description><![CDATA[I think one of the main reasons people fail at blogging is because they simply don&#039;t write enough to be successful. Writing every day, or at a minimum of several times a week, is not easy. You have to make a concerted effort to be able to produce quality content on a regular basis, and that requires you to be productive as much is possible when you are working on your blog. All of the above may not apply directly to you, but if you can find one or two things that do help you become more productive in your writing and blogging, then you come away in a better position to get more done. That&#039;s what I try to do with every article I read. Try to take a nugget that you can use in your own life to make it easier better.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I want to write 1000 words a day, but no matter how hard I try, I never seem to be able to get to that number. I always fall short. All my friends seem to be able to write that amount with ease. I&#039;m the only one who is a failure. What am I doing wrong?]]></description>
