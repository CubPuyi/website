This may be true, but the book industry knows what sells and is profitable. Sure, there may be exceptions, but it isn&#039;t worth them taking the risk with these with the number they publish. If you don&#039;t like the publisher&#039;s rules, then don&#039;t try to publish through one of them. Do it on your own.]]></description>

This. If you plan on writing a novel that you want to get published, you need to stay within the word count guidelines of your genre. If you&#039;re going to go ahead and self-publish, go ahead and knock yourself out and write as many words as you want. But if you&#039;re planning to take your novel to a publisher and your book is way outside the normal word count, they won&#039;t even consider it. I know from experience.]]></description>

Most people who write novels aren&#039;t writing them just for themselves. They are writing them in hopes that the novel will be published. And therefore knowing the acceptable word count for a novel is important. I think you are in the minority of writing just for yourself.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I understand why people say not to worry about the number of words in a novel, but if you ever want to get it published, you do have to know what publishers will and won&#039;t accept. Thinking that your novel doesn&#039;t need to abide by the rules of other novelists is a sure sign you aren&#039;t ever going to g yours published. You may be able to get away with it if you are successful, but as a first timer, good luck with that!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think you should get too hung up on the number of words - there are a lot of novels that drag on longer than they should. 

I&#039;d rather have a slightly shorter book that left me wanting more.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think it should matter how many words a novel has as long as it&#039;s good. I think the book industry does writers disservice by mandating how many words a novel can be instead of reading the writing and deciding if the novel is good or not.

					<description><![CDATA[If you&#039;re writing the novel for yourself it doesn&#039;t matter how many words. I think everyone should write their novel as if it were just for them. Then, when finished, if it feels like one that should be published, you can edit to the word count needed. Writing for the word count at the beginning will create an inferior novel in my opinion.]]></description>
