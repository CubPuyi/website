Well that was magnificently written.  Thank you.  Sure it could have been proofread and I would definitely say the content warranted it as its value was so high, but hey, people have limited time.  So thank you for what you gave.  I&#039;m sure it will help many.  Much of it could be framed on a wall.  Can&#039;t say that for the previous post though!  How about scribbled on toilet paper and flushed down the wazoo?!  (Is wazoo even a word?)]]></description>

Congratulations Jovita, while english is my only language I&#039;m always amazed that others learn it in addition to one or more they already speak. If you ever find yourself struggling and the awful thought, &quot;I&#039;ll Never Get This!&quot; pops into your mind stop right there. As you see yourself sweeping that sad short sentence away please tell yourself, &quot;Miss Sara knows how well I&#039;m doing and without knowing me is so very proud and is cheering me on&quot;.  True words for you Jovita, you and all those learning english, a language that can be so confusing even to those born to it. Happy smiles of cheer and encouragement.]]></description>
