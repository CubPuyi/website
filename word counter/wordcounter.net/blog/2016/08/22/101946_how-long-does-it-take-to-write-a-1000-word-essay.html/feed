So happy to read that! That&#039;s because I just realised, that that is what I needed to read. I&#039;ve got two months to write six 2500 word essays. I&#039;ve been procrastinating because I&#039;m simply in fear of doing a bad job. I&#039;ve done lots of research; made lots of notes; collected citations and written nothing. It&#039;s time. I can do this!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am writing a dissertation and those estimations made me positive because just 41 hour to write 12,000 essay seems nothing. But at the moment I just finished literature review(though the hardest part yet) without editing I am already at over 35 hours of work. And that&#039;s not even a half!

I completely agree with you on that one. I recently worked on a 4000 word essay, and while the research did take me three hours to conduct, I completed the essay itself in a bit less than four hours and scored a total of 32/34 points.]]></description>

I disagree, I feel 250 words is way too less to explain any topic.  In my opinion, the maximum word count for an essay should be 1500.]]></description>

It does. Sometimes, no matter how hard you look at something, you won&#039;t be satisfied with it. It may take you days to figure it out. And then, one fine day, you suddenly stand up right in the middle of breakfast and then run upstairs and then type out the right line.
