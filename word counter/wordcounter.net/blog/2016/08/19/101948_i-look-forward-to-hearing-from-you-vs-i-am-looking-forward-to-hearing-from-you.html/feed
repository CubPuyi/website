					<description><![CDATA[Hello, using the present progressive tense in „I‘m looking forward…“ indicates doing something now. „I look forward…“ means that I am generally and constantly looking forward to hearing from someone. That’s why I would use the latter form!]]></description>

Well, well, yes this is an issue when you want to take an IELTS exam and you lose general writing part one&#039;s score that easily! And still I cannot find a clear answer!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There are two different aspects to consider when deciding which form to use.
There is no doubt that “ I look forward to hearing from you “ I the formal way between the two.
As you know, when writing a letter to someone you don’t know the name of and start with “ Dear Sir or Madam”, you always have to use as salutation “ I look forward to.........
If on the other hand you are writing a letter to a friend, you always use “ I am looking.....”, as it would be incorrect and quite frankly ridiculous to use the other form!
The only case in which we may enter a grey area is when you receive a letter, email from someone you don’t know, but they address you using your first name at the beginning and their first name as salutation, using the informal “ looking forward...”.
In this case, although the person writing is not on friendly terms with you, you can reply using the same form or if you think you want to remain more formal, use the other one, both are grammatically correct in this case!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[While phrasing words in different ways can ultimately mean the same thing, I don&#039;t see it as the case in this situation. The difference isn&#039;t large, but there is a subtle difference implied between the two. &quot;I look forward...&quot; seems to be more of a demand at a response while &quot;I am looking forward...&quot; is more of a hope.]]></description>
