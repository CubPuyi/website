Your grammar was fine until the second half of your last sentence ( after the word &quot;Google&quot; ).]]></description>

Give the guy(FFXX) the benefit of the doubt.  It could&#039;ve been just a typo. I know, I know, he should&#039;ve checked his spelling etc etc, but who does?! Me?

[Yes, Gerry; acronyms are specifically initialisms that are pronounced as a word, instead of saying each letter. MUD is an acronym, while TTYL is an initialism. LOL and OMG are (unfortunately?) making a transition to acronym; at least LOL doesn&#039;t sound like you&#039;re choking, as when you try to pronounce OMG.]

Generally, acronyms and initialisms were first used in text (and then some got familiar enough that they jumped to speech); so, it&#039;s not a savings on syllables, but a savings on typing characters.  That&#039;s one reason computers have so many; the limitations that used to exist forced abbreviations, such as the 3-character limit on file extensions in DOS (Disk Operating System) that meant you labeled a text file as TXT, or an executable file as EXE, or a data file as DAT. And if you were an operator or programmer who typed constantly, every letter you could shorten from a command you often used meant a significant decrease in the number of keystrokes you subjected your digits to in the course of the day.

Cutting my teeth in early BBSs (Bulletin Board Systems), MUDs (Multi-User Dungeons or Domains) and early multiplayer games with some form of chat window, I was well-used to seeing shorthand like AFK (Away From Keys/Keyboard, or &quot;I gotta hit the head, just letting you know why I&#039;m not responding/my character is standing still for the next couple minutes; my connection didn&#039;t drop.&quot;) If someone used an abbreviation you weren&#039;t familiar with, usually a quick ? as a response would have someone expand it out for you.

Shorthand is fine; &quot;leet-speak&quot; (to signify you&#039;re cool, or &quot;elite&quot;) was often stupid. I once saw someone use &quot;N E one&quot; -- actually using *more* characters than &quot;anyone&quot;, worse if you count pressing the shift key to capitalize the first two. It was a quick way to lose the respect of serious members of many online communities.

Thank you for coming to my TED talk; I&#039;ll hand the podium back to the MC. :D]]></description>
