					<description><![CDATA[I agree. Words matter. Today I received notice that an item was delivered. It said: Congrats! Your order has arrived. They are praising and honoring me simply because my order arrived! I wonder if they&#039;re going to send me a 3-foot trophy!]]></description>

I think it depends when you use it. If it&#039;s someone graduating from elementary school, it&#039;s cute. If they are graduating from medical school, it&#039;s not.  I think the problem is there are too many people trying to be &quot;cute&quot; when congradulations has become sort of cliche.]]></description>

I agree. People think it&#039;s cute to say congradulations but it&#039;s kind of stupid. I guess if you were the first one to invent it then it would unique, but now so many people say and  it&#039;s nothing more than a cliche. Stop trying to be clever and just let people know you&#039;re proud of them. You trying to be clever just makes you look foolish.]]></description>
