					<description><![CDATA[Maybe there is someone living inside me…

Samira Mansouri

     There is something happening inside me, perhaps a new feeling is being given the birth. I don’t know what this is exactly! Perhaps a sense of excitement or a sense of accomplishment…I am getting familiar with new English words…all of them carry a burden of meaning on their shoulders. All of them are pure, honest and sincere.

     Thousands of words are emerging in unlimited writhing sky, similar to numerous stars, twinkling cheerfully. I am getting lost in a galaxy of words. I cannot imagine any ending for this sky…everywhere, thousands of new words, new words and new words. I am silent but excited. You can never deeply comprehend how disable I am to describe how enjoyable, marvelous and strange feeling I am experiencing!

     Words, all of them so powerful, are similar to the sharp axes to reform my statue. My character is gradually evolving with every hook of these words. My eyes, my hands, my fingers and my soul are getting shaped. There is someone living inside me, calling me, asking me to write in English. There is something happening inside me, maybe a colorful butterfly is being given the birth inside my heart. Maybe a silkworm is getting out of cocoon to make a difference in outside world.

     Arrangement of these generating words give me a sense of thrill…a sense of creation. I am falling in love with my every single sentence. How nice, how unique, how exhilarating they are! Perhaps there is someone living inside me that her green fingers can flourish every piece of paper. There is a gardener inside me, capable of making white and plain paper pleasing, green and spectacular garden that every reader can take a rest, free of today‘s tension and anxiety.

      Perhaps there is someone living inside me that her fingers like flexible ballerina in the stage of opera house can create a memorable drama. Oh words! Come and help me to describe what is happening in my heart, come and take my hands to go beyond the reality. I am like a dumb girl who is given the permission to sing, too excited to say even a single word…maybe my dream is coming true. I was reborn.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Avoid lengthy descriptions. &quot;Lengthy&quot; is relative to the material you&#039;re writing. If you&#039;re writing a Halmark movie style romance novel...you know, the bare-chested cowboy crap they sell at Walmart...then an entire paragraph about nothing more than the horse the cowboy is riding might be too much. However, if you&#039;re writing a post-modern encyclopedic novel then not spending an entire page describing a horse might be too little. In fact, in a post modern novel...especially of the encyclopedic variety...you could have an entire chapter about nothing more than a horse. It just depends on what works best for the story with consideration to the genre it first in.

One of the scenes that I&#039;ve never forgotten from Infinite Jest...a post-modern encyclopedic novel...is the one where the main character is sitting in the waiting room of the principal&#039;s office at his school waiting to talk to said principal while everything...and I mean EVERYTHING...in the room that is blue is described...for page after page after page. In a 200 page Harlequin romance that would be WAY too much. In Infinite Jest it was perfect.

Don&#039;t use lengthy descriptions, but DO remember &quot;lengthy&quot; is relative to the overall length of the book with respect to genre. Think of it this way...instead of saying don&#039;t use lengthy descriptions...don&#039;t use descriptions that readers will consider lengthy. If the book is 1,000 pages it won&#039;t be a secret to the reader before they start reading that something in the book will be lengthy. Most people who read longer books and post-modern novels don&#039;t expect light quick reads. For those who do expect light quick non-thought engaging reads, go to Walmart and buy the book with the &quot;sexiest&quot; cowboy on the cover.

So remember to consider what your overall page length is projected to be and what genre you&#039;re writing in and that should give you a rough guide as to what &quot;lengthy&quot; is for any and all descriptions in your book/story.]]></description>

Yes, the definition of &quot;art&quot; is a bit broad for my liking in this article. I still believe writing is an art, but I don&#039;t believe all types of writing should be considered art. For example, business writing is business writing. Someone might be good at it, but it isn&#039;t artful writing except possibly in the subset of business writing. Nobody would ever confuse a business proposal as written art.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t believe that writing gets the credit it deserves for being an art. People have the misconception that writing is easy, probably because everybody has to learn to write at some point in their life. But to bring words to life is an art.

I don&#039;t know. I would classify a writing more as a skill than as an art. I think of art as being something that is done to celebrate somebody&#039;s creativity whereas writing is a daily skill. Of course, there are times when people are writing creatively and this could be considered as art. But the day-to-day writing that everybody does is more of a skilled than an art in my opinion.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not sure I really like this explanation as the definition given means that everything and everything is an art. That&#039;s not really addressing the question in hand which most people reading this are asking -- is writing an art like painting and other activities usually associated with art. Why isn&#039;t writing thought of in this way? That&#039;s really the question that this article should address.]]></description>
