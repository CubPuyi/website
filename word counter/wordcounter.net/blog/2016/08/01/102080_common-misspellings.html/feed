					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s ironic that you mention twice in your article that Americans have trouble spelling &quot;grey&quot;. &quot;Grey&quot; with an &quot;E&quot; in the middle is the European spelling. &quot;Gray&quot; with an &quot;A&quot; in the middle is the American spelling. Americans will only encounter the word grey while reading Brittish literature, otherwise it will always be gray.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The word I always have trouble spelling is pseudonym. I mean, really, who would ever decide to spell out words that way? It&#039;s like the person who created that spelling wanted people to go crazy every time they try to spell it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love the article! I had no idea people had problems spelling these words, but I guess it makes sense. Awesome spelling exercise, by the way. :) Yeah, I agree with the previous comment, people rely way too much on auto-correct/spelling checkers. I have to admit that I use them as well, but only after my friends or I have double-checked everything; plus, it&#039;s always good to have many options/tools to compare and see which one works best.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I blame all of this on spell checkers. People no longer think they need to know how to spell because they believe the spell checker will catch and correct whatever they don&#039;t spell correctly. We have a nation of people who think getting it close (so the spell check knows) id good enough.]]></description>
