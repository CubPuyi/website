					<description><![CDATA[That was very well explained and you made it clear enough.
I wasn&#039;t sure which one Should I use. (8 Easy steps to apply? or 8 Simple Steps to apply?) Giving instructions to someone of how to perform a task on the PC. And I chose the term &quot;easy steps&quot;. Thank you.]]></description>

I&#039;m never sure which of the meanings is being used since English isn&#039;t my first language. Not knowing the meaning makes it difficult to know which one is best to use.]]></description>

Best comment. For those who haven&#039;t noticed, the comment itself uses both simple and easy to explain the meaning of simple and easy. How simple and easy was that?]]></description>

You might want to actually read the article since that&#039;s exactly what it&#039;s about. It goes through and explains exactly the difference between easy and simple. It&#039;s easy to understand if you simply take the time to read it.]]></description>
