There are better ways to increase or decrease word count than using phrasal verbs. Doing this doesn&#039;t make your writing any stronger, and often will make it weaker. Better to hit your word count by making your essay better than simply substituting words that mean the same thing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I find using phrasal verbs is an easy way to add or decrease word count depending on what you need to do for an essay. If you need to increase word count you use the phrasal verbs, but if you need to decrease your essay&#039;s word count, you use the equivalent single word. For example, instead of using &quot;get across&quot; you can use &quot;communicate&quot; or instead of using &quot;turn down&quot; you can use &quot;reject&quot; Being able to substitute phrasal verbs with their singular word equivalent is an easy way to pad or decrease your word count for essays.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for the list of phrasal verbs. That helps me understand them a bit better. I&#039;m still n completely  sure I understand them all, but the list helps me understand better than I did when I came here searching about them.]]></description>
