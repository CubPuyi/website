They do write what they mean. The problem is if you don&#039;t know the meaning of a word they use. You have two choices:

1. Look up the meaning in the dictionary.
2. Use context clues to figure out what it means.

If you aren&#039;t good at context clues, then use the dictionary.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I understand with context clues are, but is there a way to practice them? Besides just picking up a book and start reading and then trying to figure out words that you don&#039;t understand, is there someplace I can go to practice trying to figure out the context clues sort of like what you did in this article? Like a quiz or something?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The thing that I love about context clues is that when you get really good at it, you don&#039;t even realize that you&#039;re using the clues in the writing to figure out what words mean. It&#039;s kind of like a game that you get so good at that you automatically react, but in this instance your brain does the automatic reaction and gives you the meaning of a word you don&#039;t even know. It&#039;s all pretty amazing if you take the time to think about it.]]></description>
