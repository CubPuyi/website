I&#039;m 14 and really want to be a lawyer but I feel that reading fast and staying active while reading has always been a huge challenge for me. I&#039;m also quite smart...mostly in the science category but I don&#039;t really like any career in that aspect...my only choice is law...and I&#039;m kinda scary I&#039;ll suck in law]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a bit deceptive. I don&#039;t dispute there may be a lot of writing if you want to go to law school, but there is going to be a lot of writing a matter what major you decide to pursue in graduate school. Just like there is a lot of writing when you&#039;re in college, it doesn&#039;t get any better when you decide to go to graduate school. That&#039;s just the nature of academics. So, yes, there is a lot of writing you decide you want to go to law school, but there will be a lot of writing to matter what postgraduate education you pursue.]]></description>

I don&#039;t think you should really decide whether or not to be a lawyer based on the movie Clueless. Just saying...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Is there enough writing in law school that if I don&#039;t like it, I should think of doing some other career? The thought of being a lawyer is appealing to me and I was thinking of going to law school after graduating from college, but I don&#039;t like to write much. What&#039;s your opinion?]]></description>

Lawyers have to write a lot and research even more then write down what they research. This is a very time consuming process and the amount of writing that you have to do is sometimes overwhelming. This is definitely nothing like you see on the TV there is a lot more writing involved than you might think.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Most students are quite shocked when they learn that the job of  a lawyer is 90% writing. That&#039;s not only school, but he real world too. I blame it on TV shows that make it look so much different than it really is. If you don&#039;t like to write, you don&#039;t want to be a lawyer. It&#039;s as simple as that.]]></description>

Well, this makes law school sound a lot more unfun than I already thought it was going to be. I hated languages when I was in high school, so the thought of law writing being like learning a new language makes me think that this may not be what I want to do. I want to be a lawyer, but I don&#039;t want to hate being lawyer. I think I&#039;m going to have to consider long and hard on this decision.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Writing in law school is something completely new. I found that out when I start the new term. All the vocabulary is different and also the way of writing. Although difficult, it is quite possible with a lot of persistence and also practice. It might be time-consuming, but you get it after a while.]]></description>
