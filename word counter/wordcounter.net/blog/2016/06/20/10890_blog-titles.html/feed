					<description><![CDATA[I used to think that titles weren&#039;t that important until I started a blog. I started to see that some articles that weren&#039;t particularly well written compared to others would get a lot more hits. It soon became apparent that a good title could make or break an article no matter how much time I spent writing it. If you want people to visit your blog, spend more time on your titles to make them the best they can be.]]></description>

Ah!

It might be something like $35,000 - $55,000

something near the median and mean.

Because we don&#039;t like to be too apart from our friends!]]></description>

Off the top of my head, the one I remember years later is &quot;The Salary That Will Make You Happy (Hint: It&#039;s Less Than $75,000)&quot; since many people believe that they need to earn a lot more than that to be happy. In fact, I would say the majority of my friends still believe that if they just earned a higher salary, they would be happier than they are now, but studies show that that&#039;s not true.]]></description>
