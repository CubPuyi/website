I have to agree with you. Not sure why this bothers me is much as it does, but like you, I&#039;d go insane whenever I see people write a lot as alot. I was lucky that I had a teacher who made sure we didn&#039;t make this mistake when I was in middle school. That may be why seeing it still bothers me to this day.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In the time I will allot to write this comment, I want to say a lot of things such as I disapprove of people who spell &quot;a lot&quot; as &quot;alot&quot; when they write. I think I have it down now :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nothing drives me crazier than people who write &quot;alot&quot; -- I know it&#039;s irrational to get so upset about something that appears trivial, but so many people do it all the time. It&#039;s a huge pet peeve of mine. Does it bother other people as much as it bothers me?]]></description>
