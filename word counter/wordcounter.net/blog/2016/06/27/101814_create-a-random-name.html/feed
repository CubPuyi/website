This is an interesting way to use it but I had never considered before. It would be a great writing prompt to practice creative writing. I think I may give it a try in the future. Thanks for the inspiration.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I find that creating random names helps a lot when I&#039;m writing a story, especially if I&#039;m having a difficult time coming up with a name for a character. It&#039;s also much easier for me to write a character when I have a name for them since I always feel a name sort of defines a character in a way. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like to look at random names and imagine what a person with a name would be like. I think that a name can show a personality even if you&#039;ve never met the person. I know you&#039;re not supposed to judge a book by its cover, but I do think there is some truth to names and personalities. Getting a random name and imagining what that person would be like helps my creative writing.]]></description>
