					<description><![CDATA[Typing speed tests measured in words per minute (wpm) are typically a 3- or 5-minute test. The average (English) word is 5 characters long and therefore the total number of keystrokes are divided by 5 to give the speed in words per minute. Some argue the total characters should be divided by 6, since there is a space between each word - obviously, this is not popular amongst typists! Nowadays, where data entry may be highly numeric, or not prose, but names and addresses etc, the usual method is to multiply the total keystrokes achieved in 5 minutes by 12 to give a figure of anticipated keystrokes per hour (kph).]]></description>

yes its amazing, anything above 100 wpm is amazing, the average for most adults is 47 to 60, I get around 120-30 because I practiced for months and months, and if you can type 117, you can probably reach 150 real soon! don&#039;t stop practicing!]]></description>

why is everybody so concerned about typing speed? Shouldn&#039;t we be more concerned about typing accuracy than the speed? You may be the fastest typist in the world, but if you aren&#039;t able to spell the words correctly that your typing than the speed doesn&#039;t matter at all. I think it&#039;s ridiculous that everybody is so hung up on typing speed when they should be concerned about typing accuracy.]]></description>

I wish that I had learned to type better when I was younger. I had plenty of opportunities to do so, but I never took the time to really learn how. To this day I have to look at the keyboard when I type which makes my typing a lot slower than most people. I would be so much more productive if I had learned how to touch type when I was younger. If you have the opportunity to learn to type while you&#039;re still in school, take the opportunity to do it. I wish I had.]]></description>
