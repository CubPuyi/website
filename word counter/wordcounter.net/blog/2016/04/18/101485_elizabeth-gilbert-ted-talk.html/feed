I liked it. I don&#039;t think it was trying to give a specific point-by-point map for you to follow. I think the main point was to get you thinking about expectations with your writing  and to ultimately right for yourself.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Actually, this TED talk is one of the worst ones I have ever watched. She makes no points, offers no advice, and spend the whole  time talking about how she will never live up to Eat Pray Love, but how that&#039;s ok, because reasons, stupid reasons, and I hope I can save you the time of watching this utterly pointless TED talk. Dear OP: Have you nothing better to write about?]]></description>
