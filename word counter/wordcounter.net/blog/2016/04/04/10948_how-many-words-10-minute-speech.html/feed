That was 72 words. We can see how over a hundred can be a problem for you. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f61d.png" alt="üòù" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Mine&#039;s not so much a speech, but a bit for a station that needs to be 3 mins each. I was taught by my Writing for Broadcasting that 30 seconds is 85 words, and 1 minute is 185. NOT 150. This is now throwing me off and forcing me to do math I was ALWAYS horrible at even as a kid.

					<description><![CDATA[How long should √† speech be? A professor of mine once said, ‚Äúlike skirts, long enough to cover the subject and short enough to make it interesting‚Äù. Granted he was thinking of gender as well, so very inappropriate in that way. However a skirt on any body, such as a kilt for instance, makes the same point.

Thanks for your very helpful information, and all the comments that follow. This is exactly what I needed to know.]]></description>
