That&#039;s a ridiculous statement. There are many reasons for using a pseudonym and it is up to the individual as to why they make that choice. No one has the right to make a negative comment about an individual&#039;s choices about why they make this decision. If it is not harming anyone, then keep your views to yourself and try to write a successful book yourself. I can tell you, it&#039;s an incredible experience but very hard work!]]></description>

Just because you think a certain way doesn’t mean everyone else does too. It has nothing to do with lack of pride. Some of us don’t want to be known for privacy reasons. 

I would never want to be famous. Seems awful to me. If there was a way to still share my talents with the world, but keep the attention away from myself, then that would be perfect. For example, if a book signing was part of the deal, i’d be out. I prefer a simple life.

I was a singer for a while, and a huge reason I stopped is because I didn’t like how more and more people were recognizing me from my performances. There is nothing like the thrill of performing, but I value anonymity even more than my biggest passion.

TL;DR I would rather be an unknown. Publishing under a pseudonym helps you keep unwanted attention away.]]></description>

There are a lot of legitimate reasons to use one as the article pointed out. Just because that happens to be your opinion doesn&#039;t make it true. There is nothing wrong if someone wants to use a pen name when writing for whatever reason they decide it&#039;s appropriate. That doesn&#039;t make them weak in any way.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think people who use a pseudonym are weak. You should be proud of your writing and put your name behind it. It&#039;s only those people who are afraid that hide behind a pen name. If you have courage and believe that what you write, you should always use your real name and be proud of it.]]></description>
