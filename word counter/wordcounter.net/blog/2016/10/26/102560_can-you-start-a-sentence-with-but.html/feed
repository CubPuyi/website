					<description><![CDATA[Your witty way of explaining this was very helpful. I believe that information is retained best when it&#039;s presented/taught in a fun way. I am grateful to have found information on this subject because I&#039;d been taught not to use &quot;but&quot; to commence a sentence  -- and yet I was constantly seeing it used in various forms of printed works.
Thank you for sharing the all right of something I&#039;ve believed was all wrong for years.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am trying to find out if you can start a paragraph with &quot;but&quot;, but I can not find an answer. This is for a school assignment.
