I think you meant to say &quot;don&#039;t capitalize summer, spring, autumn or winter except when they happen to be part of a name&quot; :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The example sentence is repeated on numerous sites, but it is flawed.  In the phrase &quot;her spring flowers&quot;, spring is an adjective, as is winter in &quot;winter chill&quot;. If the sentenced were phrased, &quot;She loved the flowers of Spring, but could not abide the chill of Winter,&quot; then the season could be capitalized. Though many people would prefer the seasons not capitalized, to this writer it is proper, as well as respectful of the natural world.]]></description>

Oh, come on, remembering this isn&#039;t all that difficult. It&#039;s not like it&#039;s algebra or physics or anything along those lines. All you have to do is put it in your head once and you can remember it for a lifetime. It&#039;s a simple as remembering that winter, spring, summer, and fall are only capitalized when they happen to be part of a proper name.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You could have summed up this entire article by just saying you don&#039;t capitalize north, south, east or west except when they happen to be part of the name. There, I just wrote your entire article for you in a single sentence.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I wish that it were easier to remember when to capitalize things like this. It gets so confusing. capitalize months and days of the week, but not seasons? They all tell us an amount of time. It seems that seasons should be capitalized. but that&#039;s just my opinion.]]></description>
