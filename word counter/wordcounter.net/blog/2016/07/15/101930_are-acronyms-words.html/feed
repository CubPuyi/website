					<description><![CDATA[I was looking through the &#039;acronyms&#039; list and its ideas.
There should always be more than two acronyms(except for states.) Three acronyms or more should be given to specify what the acronym is trying to describe.  I don&#039;t particularly appreciate looking in some book or comp.  And find out it can mean one of, say, Five objects?]]></description>

I think that saying it by pronouncing every letter like NRA makes it Not a word. When you say NASA or SCUBA they are words because you do not pronounce every letter.]]></description>

The way I understand it, it&#039;s only an acronym if you can pronounce it as a word.  So NASCAR = acronym but FDA is not an acronym.]]></description>

I like this explanation of one an acronym is a word and when it isn&#039;t. I wouldn&#039;t consider the NRA ( National Rifle Association) to be a word because you say each individual letter when pronouncing it. Each of those letters represents a word unto itself. On the other hand, I would consider NASA to be a word because we say it is a word. I&#039;m just repeating what you have said, but I think that makes a lot of sense.]]></description>

So you don&#039;t think that the words mentioned above like &quot;scuba&quot; and &quot;taser&quot; are real words even though you can find them in the dictionary? That doesn&#039;t make any sense to me at all.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think it&#039;s appropriate to consider some acronyms is words and others is not. I think that if you say the acronym as you would pronounce a single word, then it should be considered a word. But if you say the acronym by saying each of the individual letters within the acronym, then it&#039;s not a word. So whether you consider one to be a word or not should depend on how you pronounce it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I totally disagree with this! Acronyms are letters that represent words, not words in themselves. Just because we understand what these letters represent when they&#039;re said without pronouncing each word doesn&#039;t make the acronym a word. Saying that they are is just plain wrong!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This actually ended up being more interesting that I thought it was going to be when I arrived here. I guess we take for granted that a word is a word even when it is formed from an acronym. I feel like I got a little smarter today which is always a good thing.]]></description>
