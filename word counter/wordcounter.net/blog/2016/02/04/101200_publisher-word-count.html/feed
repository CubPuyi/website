Sorry, but this observation was incorrect, and has nothing to do with digital media overtaking some forms of print. Both of you speak from limited experience, unfortunately. Digital media includes mobile devices. Word counts and fitting into a screen space are incredibly important there. Most writing and publishing is utilitarian, not recreational. Think package instructions and health information. Those things have need to fit in certain spaces and have word counts limits. Technically advanced, wealthy countries are still decades away from being able to abandon all text on packaging, public signage, many types of critical instructions, and so on. We may not ever become fully digital, because server farms consume incredible amounts of electricity and water while generating immense heat. They may not be sustainable.]]></description>
