Set realistic writing goals. You are&#039;t going to go from writing 0 words a day to writing 5,000 words a day. Start with a realistic number (300 is a good number to begin with) and then add more when you are hitting the goal each day. Remember, there is no rule you need to stop once you reach your daily word count goal. So if your goal is 300 and you hit it and still have time, write more.]]></description>

This posts helps a lot to give me some guidelines by which to improve the amount I write each day. I think we all would like to write more but it is sometimes just not possible with our daily schedules. Maybe I can make some changes to write more like I&#039;d like to do.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I never seem to be able to write as much as I want to. I have all these lofty goals of writing  thousands of words each day and in the end I sometimes write nothing. I wish I could be more productive and write more consistently. it&#039;s my dream to be a writer, so I really need to learn how to write more each day. I just don&#039;t have the focus and motivation to do it as much as I know I need to do it.]]></description>
