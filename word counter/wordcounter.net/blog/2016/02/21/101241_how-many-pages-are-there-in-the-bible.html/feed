If you are living a life of love, not persecution, a life of understanding, not hate, a life devoid of bigotry, racism, and allowing others to believe as they will, a life devoid of anything old testament, living the life according to your savior; (as he specifically pointed out that he was the new covenent) a life that does not impose your beliefs on others, our political structure, and you don&#039;t attempt to indoctrinate children that know no better, 
then peace be to you. Believe away.
If you are guilty of trespass by infringing upon us nontheists, or our children, by undermining our right to live as we see fit, by crossing the line on a single one of these guidelines, your hypocrisy will be your downfall.

Mine has 1548 does that mean mine is better, lol. No, my other one has more, because of it having larger print. There&#039;s no one exact amount unless they are made from one printing company. I own KJV and still everything written is a promise. And is true, you SEE God had sent many miracles in mine and my children&#039;s lives.]]></description>

Why would you recommend starting at the end of a book, then read the beginning, and sandwich with the end again?  Does anyone truly read any other book this way?  Or watch a movie by skipping to the end, watching the beginning, skip the middle entirely, and go back to the end?  Is it possible this is a reason so many who claim to be good Bible Believers don&#039;t even read or know their Bible?  How can this not lead to confusion on major themes and subjects throughout the entire Bible.  You can&#039;t gloss over 77% of a book and claim to know anything about its 23% ending with any intellectual integrity.  I would read the whole thing regularly if you want to know what the ENTIRE Bible should be teaching you, especially if it&#039;s your first time reading it.]]></description>
