					<description><![CDATA[Totally get it but until I read this post, I can honestly say, I had no idea that there was a difference. I guess I need to start reading further about the English language. The library is farther than I thought it was but reading once in a while might really help my brain. :)D]]></description>

Oh people probably notice. They may not tell you but it have learned from people talking about it on FB or forums how they hear it and it gets next to them.  :)]]></description>

As an ESL speaker, except and accept are actually very easy since they don&#039;t sound as similar to my untrained ear as they seem to for native speakers. It&#039;s nearly baffling to see people having difficulty with those words, and some others like then and than or affect and effect.

To me, the biggest difficulty learning English is that you can&#039;t ever seem to rely on how a word is spelled to figure out how to pronounce it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This seems overly complicated for two words that only have a single letter difference. I just use them interchangeably and nobody seems to notice the difference. If I can get my point across, what difference does it make?]]></description>
