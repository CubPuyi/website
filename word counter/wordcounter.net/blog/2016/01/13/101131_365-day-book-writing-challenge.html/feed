Writing again but can&#039;t decide if I do better starting with a new year/new sheet of numbers or start with day 49.  Leaning towards turning over a new leaf and starting from scratch but interested in advice.]]></description>

A story formula that is magic. Story must include: deity, hierarchy, sex, mystery. Learned this in college and it works like a charm! My teacher had a short he wrote: &quot;Oh my God&quot; said the princess, &quot;I&#039;m pregnant. I wonder who did it?&quot;  And then go from there. Working on a fanfic for the marvel &#039;verse with frostiron as the main pair. It has everything at we are at 44,000 and counting!]]></description>

I think you&#039;re getting a little ahead of yourself. Nobody knows whether or not their book is going to be a bestseller or make a lot of money before it&#039;s actually written. In fact, if you are going around saying that your book will be a bestseller before you have the ever written a book, you likely don&#039;t know what you&#039;ll need to do to actually write a bestseller.

 It takes a lot of work in energy beyond writing the book. before you go around telling everybody that you&#039;re going to write a bestseller, you might want to actually write the book. Then people can read it and judge it on its own merits.]]></description>

I did something similar. If I wrote more than 365 words during the day, I would cross off more than one box. There was one day when I wrote over 2000 words and I was able to cross off 10 boxes that day. My only goal was that I had to cross off at least one box each day and I ended up finishing all the boxes in less than six months. It&#039;s another great way to attack this challenge if you want to try it at a speed faster than a year.]]></description>
