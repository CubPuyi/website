					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordcounter.net/blog/2016/01/21/101075_who-versus-whom.html#comments/6224&quot;&gt;xxxxx&lt;/a&gt;.

There are plenty of native English speakers who don&#039;t use who and whom correctly.  In my experience, more so than second language learners. Native speakers think they know even though they don&#039;t and use the two in the incorrect way. Second language speakers just avoid using whom because they know they don&#039;t know how to use it correctly.]]></description>

This is one mistake I have seen loads of people make on a daily basis. English might not be an easy language to learn and I must agree that the mistake is made mostly by people who use it as a second language. This is one way to tell who is learning English and who is a native speaker. ]]></description>

Then why are you on this site searching for this topic? Who and whom are words that cause a lot of people a lot of trouble. It&#039;s good to have an explanation of the differences of the two.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for this explanation. I&#039;m not sure I totally get when to use whom instead of who, but I understand better than I did before. I always get confused when I have to make the decision of which one is correct to use. I think it would be better if we just all started to use &quot;who&quot;]]></description>
