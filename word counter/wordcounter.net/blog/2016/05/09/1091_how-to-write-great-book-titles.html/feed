If there are, understandably so, expectations about creativity, there also needs to be the will to provide a certain amount of creativity. In this case it could have meant at least reading a little bit about the movie before making such an assumption.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just a side note, don&#039;t get too attached to the title you come up with for your book(s). Your editor and publisher may change them completely even if you think the title is great.

Short and simple but also catchy is what you need to achieve. I think that is good because when you read the title you want to know what it is about so that is why you will start reading the book, but if it doesn&#039;t have a hook, you&#039;ll never bother to pick it up. Titles are a lot more important than most people think for book sales.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Some readers will actually read a book just because it has a great title. This is so important and I don&#039;t think all writers keep it in mind. The title is how your book is introduced into the world and it is also what the readers see when they first pick it up.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Titles are indeed very important. There is a restaurant called &quot;Mo&#039; Bettah&quot; and my boyfriend and I don&#039;t want to eat there just because of the name. We find it annoying. There&#039;s also a fairly new movie called &quot;The Boy&quot; and we don&#039;t want to watch it because the title is so boring that we assume the movie isn&#039;t very creative.]]></description>
