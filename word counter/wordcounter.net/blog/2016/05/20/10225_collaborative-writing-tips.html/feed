I have to agree. I would never collaborate with another person again after two awful experiences that ended up wasting so much of my time. I think writers who successfully collaborate with each other are the exception rather than the rule.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have collaborated with a number of different authors over the years, and I find in most cases it&#039;s just not worth the effort. It seems to me that most authors have very set opinions and ideas in their minds, and aren&#039;t willing to compromise in many of those situations. If you&#039;re a writer and you&#039;re not willing to compromise, you don&#039;t want to work with a collaborator. Collaboration is a team effort and you&#039;re not going to get 100% of what you have in your mind about the way the project is going to work. What most authors want when it comes to collaboration, in my opinion, is an assistant to help them with the work they don&#039;t want to do. Just my two cents.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You really need to think this through thoroughly. While having a partner can help in a great many ways, it can cause a lot of issues too. This is especially true when there is a disagreement on the vision of the project (and there will be). If you can constructively work through those disagreements, there is a chance for a good partnership. If you can&#039;t, you&#039;ll wonder why you ever thought it would be a good idea.]]></description>
