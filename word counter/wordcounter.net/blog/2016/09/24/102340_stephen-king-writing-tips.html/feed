If you don&#039;t have a full time job, three months would be plenty of time. Otherwise, squeezing it in along with work, family, exercise, etc. yep it takes longer. But I think the point is don&#039;t put it off, stay in that &quot;world&quot; you are creating as much as possible.]]></description>

Actually, it depends on how much time the writer has. If they have work or school, the time it takes to write the book will lengthen. Some writers have written their books just on weekends - which can very rarely be done in the months. But to mention people write at different places. Every writer, book, and situation is different.]]></description>

Three months fora rough draft is plenty of time if you are serious about writing a book. People do it in a single month for National Novel Writing Month each November. it&#039;s all a matter if you are serious about it or not.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Three months to write a book? That&#039;s just insane. I have writer friends still on their first draft 4 years later. I guess if you want to churn out crap you can do it in three months, but any decent book needs to take more time than that.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think the &quot;quit watching TV&quot; is a huge one just for the amount of time it frees up to write. I always hear about people who say they don&#039;t have time to write, but they have a list of TV shows they watch every night. If writing isn&#039;t a higher priority than a TV show, then you really don&#039;t want to be a writer.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I admire Stephen King so much. His advice helped me get my first novel written and is currently helping me get the second one done as well. He gives such down to earth and basic writing advice without any of the unnecessary crap you often here. Just write and read every chance you get. It really is that simple.]]></description>
