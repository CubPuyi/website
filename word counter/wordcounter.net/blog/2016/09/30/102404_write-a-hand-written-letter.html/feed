Great ideas, &#039;hb&#039;. Apart from the thoughtfulness of a letter, your point about cursive handwriting not being taught (or practised enough) is so true. Also, it seems to me that text messaging including WhatsApp etc. encourages bad or no punctuation, no capitalisation etc (ad nauseum).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Your grandchildren, who probably aren&#039;t taught to write or read cursive handwriting, also love to receive your letters, though it may take a little effort for them to read your &quot;antique&quot; handwriting - and they&#039;ll write back (sometimes trying to practice cursive handwriting, too), especially if you include a stamped, self-addressed envelope &#038; attractive note paper! I learn more family tidbits that way.]]></description>
