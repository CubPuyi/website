					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordcounter.net/blog/2016/09/08/102330_specially-vs-especially.html#comments/9416&quot;&gt;Rhonda&lt;/a&gt;.

I had the same question &#038; found this from the Cambridge online dictionary:
specially
adverb [ not gradable ] US ​  /ˈspeʃ·ə·li/
in a particular way or for a particular purpose:  &quot;Her wheelchair was specially designed for her.&quot;   
So yes, it is a word and it has a distinct meaning. I don&#039;t think we can substitute &quot;especially&quot; here, in the above example.]]></description>

Or you could learn to properly use both words. Sometimes it&#039;s worthwhile learning the difference between two words like specially and especially instead of opting for the easy way out. ]]></description>
