					<description><![CDATA[I need assistance with a name that ends in s. For example, Polyphemus from the Odyssey. 
I am speaking of when Odysseus stabbed Polyphemus in the eye

...so they could plunge the fiery steak into Polyphemus&#039;s eye 

Did I do that correctly? Or do I just use Polyphemus&#039; eye?]]></description>

Darn, this is one of my &quot;favorites&quot; (or you could say one of my pet peeves). &#039;Hope you got advice elsewhere before having the sign made. The fire pit belongs to both of the Barczaks. Therefore, a sign should say The Barczaks&#039; Fire Pit. Over the years, I have seen that most people&#039;s signs of this nature are incorrect. It drives me crazy!  Also, if a last name ends in s, like Simmons, it would read The Simmonses&#039; Fire Pit.]]></description>

The Barczaks&#039; is correct, since it&#039;s a plural possessive like Simpsons&#039;]]></description>

(I&#039;m responding even though this was sent four years ago), but with words that end with &quot;s&quot; in a possessive manner have an apostrophe after the word. For example, consider my name. My last name is Jones, so in a possessive scenario in a sentence say, &quot;That is Levi Jones&#039; property&quot; you would use the apostrophe.]]></description>
