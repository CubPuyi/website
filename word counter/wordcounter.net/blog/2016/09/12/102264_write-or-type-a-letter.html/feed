					<description><![CDATA[For friendly personal letters, if I have all the time to spare , I&#039;ll take the time to write the letter by hand. My handwriting isn&#039;t that great, and it&#039;s time-consuming to try to make it legible. JFK&#039;s handwriting is a quadrillion times more legible than mines.  If, OTOH, I&#039;ve got other disasters that are waiting for my immediate attention , then I&#039;ll type the letter in my old, dusty and trusty,  manual 1919 Oliver typewriter.  I&#039;m pretty fast at typing on this typewriter, mistakes and all. I don&#039;t go back worrying about typos, misspellings, grammar, punctuation, cross-outs. It&#039;s a single take, and it&#039;s a wrap.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[These days writing a letter maybe out of fashion or something like dope but to maintain or enhance our skills in writing or using words i will always recommend you to write letters especially to your loved ones or friends who live far away. The advantage with typing  is that it promises to reach on time if its something formal we want to write it is always better to write  a letter well we do use texts to save time that is actually better than writing letters but writing letters can create that need to read the thing . Writing to beloved ones and getting letters from beloved ones is always better than just texting them. These days some children don&#039;t even know how to write a letter they just text due to this the kids get spoiled always using the computer or the phone to chat and stuff. i recommend all parents to encourage their children to write letters to their loved ones at least. That&#039;s all from me 
thank you]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well,I would receive handwritten official letters especially in cases where I&#039;d need to do an unmanipulated check into the writer&#039;s personality.

...And about making errors in handwriting,why do typos exist?]]></description>

How obnoxious can you be? Just because you may not write letters doesn&#039;t mean that they aren&#039;t cherished by others. When&#039;s the last time you&#039;ve reread an email time and again as I often do with the letters I&#039;ve received? What you may think as antiquated shows how much you care for someone. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Do people even write letters these days? That seems so old school and such a waste of time. There is a thing called e-mail and texting. I&#039;m 22 years old and I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever received a letter in the mail other than from companies or utilities. I think in this day and age letter writing is obsolete and the only people who would consider doing it and out of touch of the reality of today&#039;s technology.]]></description>
