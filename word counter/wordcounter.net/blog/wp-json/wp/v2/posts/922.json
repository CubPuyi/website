What isn&#8217;t often considered is the sheer number of words a person who reads the entire series consumes. For those who like to keep track of their reading <a href=\"https:\/\/wordcounter.net\/\">word count<\/a> &#8212; or those who want to encourage their kids to read more &#8212; the Harry Potter books series is an excellent way to do so.<\/p>\n<p>So, how many total words are there in the Harry Potter series? The answer may surprise you. The total number of words for the Harry Potter series is over 1 million words. That&#8217;s correct. If you want your kids to read over one million words in a short period of time, one of your best chances is to get them interested in the Harry Potter book series.<\/p>\n<p>In order to reach the 1 million plus word count, it&#8217;s necessary to read all seven books which are part of the series. These include the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#8217;s Stones<\/li>\n<li>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets<\/li>\n<li>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban<\/li>\n<li>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire<\/li>\n<li>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix<\/li>\n<li>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince<\/li>\n<li>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Not all the books are the same when it comes to the number of words in them. The book with the least total number of words is <em>Sorcerer&#8217;s Stones,<\/em> while the book with the most words is <em>Order of the Phoenix<\/em>. Only 2 of the 7 Harry Potter books came in at under 100,000 words (<em>Sorcerer&#8217;s Stones<\/em> and <em>Chamber of Secrets<\/em>) which happened to be the first two books in the series. Only one book (<em>Order of the Phoenix<\/em>) topped 200,000 words, but there were two books that came close with more than 190,000 words (<em>Goblet of Fire<\/em> and <em>Deathly Hallows<\/em>). When added all together, <strong>the Harry Potter books contain 1,084,170 words<\/strong>. Below you&#8217;ll find the total word count numbers for each book in the Harry Potter series:<\/p>\n<p>How many words are in <strong><em>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#8217;s Stones<\/em><\/strong>? There are <strong>76,944 words<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>How many words are in <strong><em>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets<\/em><\/strong>? There are <strong>85,141 words<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>How many words are in <strong><em>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban<\/em><\/strong>? There are <strong>107,253 words<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>How many words are in <strong><em>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire<\/em><\/strong>? There are <strong>190,637 words<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>How many words are in <strong><em>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix<\/em><\/strong>? There are <strong>257,045 words<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>How many words are in <strong><em>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince<\/em><\/strong>? There are <strong>168,923 words<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>How many words are in <strong><em>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows<\/em><\/strong>? There are <strong>198,227 words<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>While knowing the total number of words in the Harry Potter series isn&#8217;t going to convince anyone to read all the books, knowing the total word count is an excellent way to encourage kids to read more. Reading over 1 million words is a great accomplishment which can be celebrated in addition to the fun and adventure that comes with reading the books. Now you know you can congratulate anyone who has read all the Harry Potter books of reading more than a million words.<\/p>\n<h2>10 Surprising Facts About Harry Potter<\/h2>\n<p><center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/8PxX1mzKEnI?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/center><\/p>\n<p>(<a href=\"http:\/\/editorial.designtaxi.com\/news-longbook2507\/big.jpg\">Image Source<\/a>)<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Harry Potter books are popular, and once someone reads the first book in the series, they often end up reading the entire series.
