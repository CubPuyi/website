To answer the question, &#8220;Is &#8216;couth&#8217; is a word?&#8221; we&#8217;ll have to go on a journey through time and the English language. Buckle your safety belt; it&#8217;s going to be an interesting ride. For those looking for a general answer, &#8220;couth&#8221; is becoming recognized as a real word as it appears in more and more dictionaries, but it isn&#8217;t universally accepted as a word at this time.<\/p>\n<h2>Couth in the Beginning<\/h2>\n<p>Long, long ago, the word &#8220;couth&#8221; was used to describe a person or group of people who was familiar. The opposite of that word, &#8220;uncouth&#8221; was used to describe a foreign or unknown person, usually with habits that were unfamiliar to the couth. Now, most of us aren&#8217;t comfortable with foreign habits and mores, and the meaning of the word &#8220;uncouth&#8221; began to morph into a term for those with bad manners. Meanwhile &#8220;couth&#8221; gradually fell out of common usage, became archaic, and was forgotten altogether.<\/p>\n<h2>Uncouth and a Joke<\/h2>\n<p>By the time people got around to writing full English dictionaries, only one word remained, &#8220;uncouth.&#8221; Now usually, a word featuring an &#8220;un&#8221; is attached to another word, and the prefix makes it mean the opposite thing, but &#8220;uncouth&#8221; was a peculiar anomaly because &#8220;couth&#8221; wasn&#8217;t an accepted word at all, at least, not in modern parlance.<\/p>\n<p>It seems most likely that introducing &#8220;couth&#8221; as a word describing someone with good manners, initially started out as a joke. &#8220;Haven&#8217;t you got no couth?&#8221; someone would ask before dissolving into gales of laughter at their own wit. It could even be that people looking for an impressive-sounding word for &#8220;good manners&#8221; decided that &#8220;couth&#8221; was the logical opposite of &#8220;uncouth.&#8221; If they did, people would have laughed at their ignorance because they were all too palpably wrong.<\/p>\n<h2>Couth Becomes More Real<\/h2>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the funny thing. Whether as a joke or not, the word &#8220;couth&#8221; began to be used more and more in its new context. It still wasn&#8217;t completely accepted, but it was a word people used, and words people use become part of the language. It&#8217;s the natural order of things. The <a href=\"https:\/\/wordcounter.net\/blog\/2016\/06\/02\/101702_how-fast-average-person-speaks.html\">average English speaker<\/a> from a few hundred years ago probably wouldn&#8217;t understand half of what we say, while we would certainly struggle to understand him. That&#8217;s because <a href=\"https:\/\/wordcounter.net\">words<\/a> and word usages keep changing all the time.<\/p>\n<p>Not all that long ago, you wouldn&#8217;t have found the word &#8220;couth&#8221; in any dictionary, but today, you&#8217;ll find it in quite a few. Some will note it has a &#8220;humorous&#8221; origin, while others appear to take it perfectly seriously. But there are still dictionaries that don&#8217;t contain the word at all and don&#8217;t accept it as a proper English word. Who is right?<\/p>\n<h2>So, Is Couth a Real Word?<\/h2>\n<p>&#8220;Couth&#8221; is becoming more accepted as an English word, but it isn&#8217;t universally accepted at this time. It is by no means the only English word to be formed from a mistaken assumption. A source I looked at pointed out that &#8220;burgle&#8221; was only coined in the 19th century on the assumption that &#8220;burgling&#8221; is what a burglar does. Today, it&#8217;s 100% acceptable as a word, but I think we need to be a bit cautious with our couth. It&#8217;s still a little bit on the new side of acceptable.<\/p>\n<h2>Will Couth Become a Real Word?<\/h2>\n<p>We don&#8217;t know. It may fall into disuse and join its predecessor form of &#8220;couth&#8221; in the archives of little known and seldom remembered language, or it might stick, and become a perfectly serious word that is much quicker and easier to type or say than &#8220;well-mannered.&#8221; Who will decide? The popular vote of course. How do we vote for a word? By using it when we speak and write. For now, I would recommend using &#8220;couth&#8221; in its humorous context only and not including it in any formal essays or reports, at least for the present. After all, you wouldn&#8217;t want to end up in a heated argument with a teacher who subscribes to the idea that &#8220;couth&#8221; just doesn&#8217;t cut it as a word, and that it was uncouth, or at least ignorant, of you to include it in your essay.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Language is dynamic, and today&#8217;s slang becomes tomorrow&#8217;s accepted dictionary word.
