Would you like it to be really catchy? Why not go with what works for everyone, and use the most popular words found in hit songs? If you&#8217;re wondering whether there actually are words that songwriters continually resort to, it won&#8217;t take you long to hit on the word &#8220;love.&#8221; I have no idea how many songs contain that word, but I&#8217;m ready to bet they number in the <a href=\"https:\/\/wordcounter.net\/blog\/2016\/09\/21\/102367_tens-of-thousands.html\">tens of thousands<\/a>, hundreds of thousands, or even millions!<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a great song lyric:<\/p>\n<p>Love, love, love<br \/>\nLove, love, love<br \/>\nI got love<br \/>\nYou got love<br \/>\nWe got love<br \/>\nEverybody&#8217;s got looooooove!<\/p>\n<p>ALRIGHT ALREADY! I&#8217;ll stop! Please don&#8217;t hit me over the head again! I thought it was an absolutely brilliant lyric&#8230; My artistic sensibilities are wounded, I tell you. Wounded!<\/p>\n<h2>In the Interests of Linguistics, Science and Music<\/h2>\n<p>Owing to the stiff critique my first ever song lyric faced, I decided to look for other words that are popular in songs. If I can find enough, I can make a song generator. You know: list of first lines, list of second lines, list of third lines &#8211; join the dots between them and combine them anyhow you like, and voila! One perfect song lyric. And in case you&#8217;re wondering, I&#8217;ve seen it done, and it works!<\/p>\n<p>Before we can start generating phrases, we need the words. The first thing you&#8217;ll likely notice is popular words in songs tend to be short. You aren&#8217;t going to find a lot of <a href=\"https:\/\/wordcounter.net\/blog\/2016\/10\/19\/102556_shakespeare-common-every-day-quotes.html\">Shakespeare<\/a> in most popular song lyrics. You&#8217;ll also find words are rather genre specific. For instance, &#8220;dark, black, bloody, thunder, fire, ice, and angels&#8221; all sound like they fit into gothic or metal genres, but we&#8217;ll take a broader overview.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Yeah (Now there&#8217;s a great word! You can write a whole song&#8230; Noooo! I promise I won&#8217;t! Just saying! Put down that baseball bat!)<\/li>\n<li>Feel (Aw, c&#8217;mon! Are you saying I can&#8217;t just use &#8220;Love,&#8221; &#8220;Yeah,&#8221; and &#8220;Feel&#8221; as the only words longer than three letters in my song? No fair! I thought I was getting real artistic depth there. So what if I added&#8230;.)<\/li>\n<li>Girl (There! My song has a girl in it! Better? No? Onward!)<\/li>\n<li>Heart (What, you want more? Ok. What if I give you a whole bunch more words? Will you let me write my song then? Here goes at rapid fire.)<\/li>\n<li>Take<\/li>\n<li>Life<\/li>\n<li>Back<\/li>\n<li>Never<\/li>\n<li>Die<\/li>\n<li>Away<\/li>\n<li>Give<\/li>\n<li>Time<\/li>\n<li>Night<\/li>\n<li>Day<\/li>\n<li>Man<\/li>\n<li>Dream<\/li>\n<li>World<\/li>\n<li>Little<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Song Attempt Number Two<\/h2>\n<p>Ahem. Pretends to tune guitar. Gets up close to mic. Closes eyes. Opens mouth. Sings:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Oh <strong>yeah<\/strong>! Can you <strong>feel<\/strong> it <strong>girl<\/strong>?<br \/>\nIt&#8217;s a new <strong>life<\/strong>, a new <strong>day<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Never<\/strong> say <strong>die<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Take<\/strong> the <strong>night away<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Give<\/strong> me <strong>time<\/strong> to <strong>dream<\/strong>&#8230;&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Buzzers buzz. Got Talent judges give thumbs down. Objects:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Nonsense! It&#8217;s a great song! It has all the best words in it!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Gets booed off stage for being a spoilsport. Mutters, &#8220;I know what went wrong. It was all the times I used &#8220;the.&#8221; Next time, I&#8217;ll leave it out.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Heads home and\u00a0sulks. Looks for more popular song words for music inspirations. Jackpot! Now I have:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Baby<\/li>\n<li>Good<\/li>\n<li>Keep<\/li>\n<li>Around<\/li>\n<li>Again<\/li>\n<li>Eye<\/li>\n<li>Mind<\/li>\n<li>Fall<\/li>\n<li>World<\/li>\n<li>Time<\/li>\n<li>Hell<\/li>\n<li>We<\/li>\n<li>Like<\/li>\n<li>Breathe<\/li>\n<li>Ya<\/li>\n<li>You<\/li>\n<li>Thang<\/li>\n<li>Get<\/li>\n<li>Fire<\/li>\n<li>Rock<\/li>\n<li>Don&#8217;t<\/li>\n<li>Woman (Oh!

I slipped back to the 1940&#8217;s with those last three. I thought they were rather strange. I mean, when last did you hear a song that goes:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Yeah! Baby! Let&#8217;s Polka that thang all night long!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t somehow think it&#8217;s going to hit the charts.<\/p>\n<p>Favorite words in songs have changed through the decades as we saw with &#8220;Polka&#8221; once being a popular song staple. The reality is popular song words in the past ago aren&#8217;t the same as they are today. Let&#8217;s take a quick spin through the decades:<\/p>\n<h2>Since 2010<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We<\/li>\n<li>Yeah<\/li>\n<li>Hell<\/li>\n<li>Die<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>What a cheerful bunch we are. I even had to censor one word out. Traveling back a decade&#8230;<\/p>\n<h2>2000s<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>U<\/li>\n<li>Like<\/li>\n<li>Breathe<\/li>\n<li>It<\/li>\n<li>Ya<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Perhaps just a little more cheerful. And back again&#8230;<\/p>\n<h2>1990s<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>U<\/li>\n<li>You<\/li>\n<li>Up<\/li>\n<li>Get<\/li>\n<li>Thang<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I never realized &#8220;thang&#8221; was retro.

I am not sure who Josh is, but he was in a lot of songs. He may have been someone&#8217;s uncle, because &#8220;uncle&#8221; also hits top ratings. With my next song, perhaps I should try to span the decades. No! Don&#8217;t run away! Really! Some people.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Are you writing a song?
