While this may seem obvious, it actually took me a long time to learn, and I know other writers who struggle to do this as well. Wanting to write more and actually taking the steps to write more are two completely different things. It took a long time for this to click for me, and I&#8217;m sure there are others out there who struggle with it without even realizing they haven&#8217;t noticed the difference. If you find you have all the best intentions to write 1000 words a day, but you aren&#8217;t able to reach that goal more days than you&#8217;re able to, there&#8217;s a good chance you aren&#8217;t making your writing a priority.<\/p>\n<p>Making your writing a priority will mean you&#8217;re going to have to make some changes to your schedule. It may mean you will have to delay, or even give up, some of the things you enjoy doing. You&#8217;re going to have to make a concerted effort to <a href=\"https:\/\/wordcounter.net\/blog\/2015\/10\/03\/10697_write-in-the-morning.html\">put aside time<\/a> to make sure you have the opportunity to reach your daily <a href=\"https:\/\/wordcounter.net\/blog\/2015\/10\/01\/10644_october-writing-challenge.html<\/a>word count goal<\/a>, and that often takes a lot more effort than many writers expect.<\/p>\n<p>I used to enjoy waking up in the morning and watching the morning news. I had convinced myself that it was important to stay informed about what&#8217;s going on in the world. Even when I told myself I wanted to write more, I refused to stop watching the morning news at first. It took awhile for it to dawn on me that I was prioritizing watching news over my writing goals. I had been telling myself that writing more was a top priority for me even though my actions told a different story. <\/p>\n<p>The reality is that I liked watching the morning news because it was easy and comfortable. It&#8217;s a lot easier to get up in the morning, make myself a cup of tea, relax watching TV, and putz around than it is to get up, <a href=\"https:\/\/wordcounter.net\/blog\/2015\/10\/02\/10678_find-your-quiet-activity.html\">take a walk and begin writing<\/a>. This is one example of a change I needed to make to my daily routine to truly make writing a priority. Some others included watching less Netflix, not wasting time on the computer, and limiting the time I spent on several of my favorite hobbies.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a challenge. Take a look at the things you are actually doing each day. The things you&#8217;re actually doing are what you are prioritizing over the things you aren&#8217;t able to find the time do. If the things you&#8217;re actually doing aren&#8217;t consistent with what you say you want to be doing, then either one of two things is going on:<\/p>\n<p>1. What you say you want to do isn&#8217;t really a priority<\/p>\n<p>2. You need to change your life so that you&#8217;re actually doing what is a priority.<\/p>\n<p>For most people, you&#8217;re going to have to make changes so writing becomes a priority (if it was already a priority, you&#8217;d already have no problem reaching your <a href=\"https:\/\/wordcounter.net\/\">daily word count goal<\/a>). This is especially true if your goal is to write more on a daily basis. It&#8217;s often not easy to find the extra time to write as much as you want, but if writing 1000 words a day (or whatever your daily writing goal may be) is something you truly want to do, you&#8217;ll find a way to make that time.<\/p>\n<p>On a side note, this really applies to all areas of your life, not just writing. It&#8217;s good to do a monthly audit of how you spend your time to make sure you&#8217;re spending it doing the activities that are most important to you. If you find you aren&#8217;t spending time in a way that aligns with your goals, you need to figure out a way to change up your routine so those things most important to you become a priority.
