If you think this word is a rather cruel joke at the expense of those who have this phobia, you&#8217;re absolutely right. If you have collapsed into a quivering heap, you aren&#8217;t reading this anyway, so we&#8217;ll continue without fear of reprisals.<\/p>\n<p>Luckily, even though most people don&#8217;t like <a href=\"https:\/\/wordcounter.net\/blog\/2016\/04\/11\/101421_what-is-the-longest-word.html\">extremely long words<\/a>, few people have an actual phobia of\u00a0them. If they did, it would be a little kinder to use the scientifically accepted term. Unfortunately, although it&#8217;s a little shorter, it isn&#8217;t that much better. Sesquipedalophobia is about half as long and presumably half as frightening to the phobia sufferer.<\/p>\n<p>If you have this fear, which you clearly don&#8217;t since you&#8217;re still with us, it must be difficult to talk to your therapist about your problem, &#8220;I suffer from hippoptomnghurgh&#8230;. I mean&#8230; Sesquipedaaaaarrrgggh!&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2>Are there words that are even longer?<\/h2>\n<p>Since you&#8217;re still reading this, your aversion for long words can&#8217;t be all that bad, but after reading about the longest words ever to be coined and used, you may change your mind.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Honorificabilitudinitatibus<\/strong> is the longest word that Shakespeare ever used. It means &#8220;the ability to receive honors,&#8221; but it&#8217;s not only its length that makes it stand out; it also uses alternating consonants and vowels and is the longest word to have this interesting characteristic.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Antidisestablishmentarianism<\/strong> is the longest word in the Oxford Dictionary that wasn&#8217;t just invented and that isn&#8217;t a technical term. Unless you are concerned about the disestablishment of the Church of England as the official church in England and Wales, it probably isn&#8217;t worth learning.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis<\/strong>, a technical term for a medical condition caused by inhaling silica dust, is the longest word to be listed in a formal dictionary. Luckily for those unfortunate enough to have it, learning how to pronounce this eye-watering word won&#8217;t be necessary since it has another, much easier name.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch<\/strong> is a place in Wales that demonstrates the Welsh fondness for combining consonants in seemingly unpronounceable ways, but luckily for its residents, the name has been abbreviated to Llanfair PG. Amazingly, Microsoft&#8217;s spell-checker recognizes this word when it is in UK English mode.<\/p>\n<p>As for the very longest word ever, it has 189,819 letters, and I&#8217;m not even going to try to write it. It comes from organic chemistry, where the names of compounds are derived from the molecule chains they consist of. This word describes a complex protein and is said to take over three hours to pronounce.<\/p>\n<h2>Hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia and other phobias<\/h2>\n<p>If you think a fear of long words is a strange phobia to have, there are some even stranger ones that presumably present a real problem for a few people. Phobias are irrational fears, so we tend to make fun of people who have them. I realize this is rather cruel, but let&#8217;s take a short foray into political incorrectness and look at some of the odder ones. If you don&#8217;t suffer from them, you may find it amusing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Coulrophobia<\/strong>, the fear of clowns, is actually quite common, especially among children.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Hylophobia<\/strong> is the fear of trees &#8211; &#8220;wood&#8221; you believe it? I blame the Brothers Grimm and their fairy tales. Kids shouldn&#8217;t read such scary stuff. Admittedly, I read their stories in the directly translated form as a child, and I loved the gruesome bits most of all.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Omphalophobia<\/strong> is the fear of belly buttons. Every few years, cropped tee shirts become the fashion, and that must be hard for the Omphalophobe, but just think what a trip to the beach would do to them.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Nomophobia<\/strong> could be something you will identify with. It&#8217;s the fear of being without a mobile phone signal.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Triskadecaphobia<\/strong> describes the fear of the number 13. If I wanted to be nasty, I would list 13 phobias just to terrify a small percentage of my readership, but I&#8217;ll be kind.<\/p>\n<h2>If a friend has Hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia<\/h2>\n<p>Before you beg them to see a therapist, you can try a little therapy of your own just to see if it drives them even crazier than they already are. If it doesn&#8217;t, it may cure them. Give them this article to read aloud, and don&#8217;t let them stop until they&#8217;ve gone through the whole thing. If they can get past Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch without having a fit, there&#8217;s hope. If they can actually pronounce it correctly, I would love to meet them.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you have not yet closed your browser in a fit of abject terror, you probably don&#8217;t suffer from hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia, the fear of long words.
