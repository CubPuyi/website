A good example of this confusion is <a href=\"https:\/\/wordcounter.net\/blog\/2016\/01\/18\/101070_further-away-versus-farther-away.html\">further versus farther<\/a>. Another common word duo many people have difficulty knowing which is correct is &#8216;who&#8217; and &#8216;whom&#8217;.<\/p>\n<p>Very few people bother to use the word &#8216;whom&#8217; in spoken English, but when we&#8217;re writing, we want to use the correct grammar. Since we so seldom use &#8216;whom&#8217;, we aren&#8217;t always sure when it is the right choice, or when we should stick to the familiar &#8216;who&#8217; instead.<\/p>\n<p>Most experts agree that if we are unsure, &#8216;who&#8217; is a safer bet. And it&#8217;s fine for informal writing &#8211; after all &#8216;whom&#8217; is slowly disappearing from our language. However, if we have to produce formal written work, we do need to know when to use the mysterious &#8216;whom&#8217;. Put it in the wrong places, and you&#8217;ll look pompous and silly. Omit it when you should have used it, and you&#8217;ll look unprofessional if your error is picked up.<\/p>\n<p>First of all, we&#8217;ll look at the rule that governs the use of &#8216;whom&#8217;, and then, to make it easier for you, we&#8217;ll look at a little &#8216;cheat&#8217; that you can use to test a sentence when you aren&#8217;t sure which of the two words belongs.<\/p>\n<h2>The rule governing the use of &#8216;who&#8217; and &#8216;whom&#8217;<\/h2>\n<p>Look at the verb in your sentence. Is &#8216;who&#8217; performing the action? If so, &#8216;who&#8217; is the right choice to make. So &#8216;who&#8217; is the subject of a verb &#8211; the one who is the doer!<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li> Who is there?<\/li>\n<li> Do you know who will attend the conference?<\/li>\n<li> Who threw that snowball?<\/li>\n<li> I got hit by a snowball and I want to know who threw it!<\/li>\n<li> This is the man who won the prize.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You&#8217;ve probably already guessed that since you choose &#8216;who&#8217; when the person you&#8217;re referring to is the subject of your verb, you&#8217;ll use &#8216;whom&#8217; when the person becomes the object of the verb. The object is acted on by the verb rather than being the one responsible for the action.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li> With whom were you out last night?<\/li>\n<li> We will inform those whom we shortlist.<\/li>\n<li> Be selective about those whom you choose as friends.<\/li>\n<li> To whom should the invoice be sent?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>An easy &#8216;cheat&#8217;<\/h2>\n<p>Although we tend to be confused about when to use the word &#8216;who&#8217; and the contexts in which &#8216;whom&#8217; is the correct choice, we&#8217;re much more familiar with the words &#8216;he&#8217; and &#8216;him&#8217; and &#8216;they&#8217; and &#8216;them&#8217;. We instinctively know which of the words in these pairs fit into any sentence.<\/p>\n<p>You will have noticed that &#8216;whom&#8217;, &#8216;him&#8217; and &#8216;them&#8217; all end in the letter &#8216;m&#8217;, and the rule for choosing &#8216;them&#8217; or &#8216;him&#8217; rather than &#8216;they&#8217; or &#8216;he&#8217; is exactly the same as it is for &#8216;who&#8217; and &#8216;whom&#8217;. By playing around with the sentence you plan to write, substituting &#8216;he&#8217; or &#8216;him&#8217; for &#8216;who&#8217; or &#8216;whom&#8217; you can get a pointer that tells you which of the two words will be correct. Of course, that won&#8217;t work as well for questions, but in that case, you can try answering the question as simply as possible to get your pointer.<\/p>\n<p>Question: Who \/ Whom is knocking on the door? Answer: He is knocking.<\/p>\n<p>So now we know that the right word to use in the question is &#8216;who&#8217;.<\/p>\n<p>I met three men, one of who \/ whom is an astronaut. I met three men, one of them is an astronaut.<\/p>\n<p>In this case, &#8216;whom&#8217; matches &#8216;them&#8217; and would be the correct word to use.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, our little cheat doesn&#8217;t always work as easily as it does in the above examples. If you find yourself struggling, you&#8217;ll have to return to your verb so you can decide whether who \/ whom is the subject or object of the verb. Always remember a subject performs the action indicated by the verb while the object is on the receiving end.<\/p>\n<p>You can also look at where your prepositions are located. &#8216;Whom&#8217; often follows a preposition. For example: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li> With whom<\/li>\n<li> Of whom<\/li>\n<li> Beside whom<\/li>\n<li >After whom<\/li>\n<li> Around whom<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Still worried?<\/h2>\n<p>Remember, the subtleties which dictate when we use &#8216;who&#8217; and when we use &#8216;whom&#8217; are not clear to the majority of people. Unless you are writing a formal document, you can choose &#8216;who&#8217; and hope for the best. But if you can master the &#8216;who \/ whom&#8217; distinction, you&#8217;ll be ahead of the pack, and that&#8217;s always a great place to be. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When it comes to writing, there are some words that can be confusing as to which is the correct one to use.
