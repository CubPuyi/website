Do you see the &#8220;for&#8221; in &#8220;former&#8221;? Use it to tell you the thing you&#8217;re talking about came before another thing that you mentioned.<\/p>\n<p>Do you see the &#8220;latte&#8221; in &#8220;latter&#8221;? That means you should have a cup of coffee! OK. Kidding, but it sounds a lot like &#8220;later&#8221; doesn&#8217;t it? That tells you that the thing you&#8217;re referring to came later than, or after something else.<\/p>\n<h2>Former and Latter in Action<\/h2>\n<p>Let&#8217;s make these words jump through some hoops!<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It was raining, and there was lightening in the air. Mary didn&#8217;t mind the <strong>former<\/strong> problem, but the <strong>latter<\/strong> one troubled her because she was afraid of thunder.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;You need to have a lot of determination to <a href=\"https:\/\/wordcounter.net\/blog\/2016\/05\/16\/101630_college-admissions-essay.html\">get through college<\/a>, and you have to be ready to do a lot of hard work. If I <a href=\"https:\/\/wordcounter.net\/blog\/2016\/03\/21\/101072_when-to-use-was-versus-were.html\">were<\/a> to rate these two, I&#8217;d say the <strong>latter<\/strong> point is the most important to your success.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If I had to choose between good looks and intelligence, I think I&#8217;d go for the <strong>former<\/strong> advantage!&#8221; (Silly you!)<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I love John Keats and William Shakespeare, but the <strong>latter<\/strong> seems to have more applicability to today&#8217;s word.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes, more than two things will be mentioned, with &#8220;latter&#8221; used to denote what is last. Using &#8220;former&#8221; in this context may be confusing because it doesn&#8217;t really tell you which of the items that came first you&#8217;re referring to.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;There were apples, pears, oranges and grapes on the table, but it was the <strong>latter<\/strong> that made Joan&#8217;s mouth water!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;There were apples, pears, oranges and grapes on the table, but the <strong>former<\/strong> of these fruits seemed the most appealing.&#8221; See what I mean? We can assume Joan found the apples appealing, but with a list such as this, we can&#8217;t be sure. It would be better to just say what we meant and get it over with! Joan found the apples appealing. The End.<\/p>\n<h2>Should You Use Former and Latter?<\/h2>\n<p>To tell you the truth, using words like &#8220;former&#8221; or &#8220;latter&#8221; can make your reader go back to reread the first part of a sentence, and that isn&#8217;t a great strategy. It&#8217;s cumbersome! And even if you change things around and warn people to look out for the former or latter point before stating them, it sounds a little pompous. Even in business writing, coming across as a person who is easy to understand and communicate with is an advantage.<\/p>\n<p>So you could start by warning people to look out for the first or second thing you say, but there are easier and more comfortable ways to do it. For instance:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Which of these options do you prefer, the former, or the latter?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Versus<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Choose one of these two options.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Or<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Which of these two options would you prefer, the first or the second?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s nothing actually wrong with using &#8220;former&#8221; and &#8220;latter,&#8221; but to be honest with you, I never do. It&#8217;s rather archaic, even though the two words are still in use, and there just seem to be easier ways to say things. I mean, when&#8217;s the last time you use either of these words in a conversation with a friend? I thought so!<\/p>\n<p>Words to read and understand, and probably not to use.<\/p>\n<p>There are a lot of words out there that are important for you to understand, but that you may never use in your own writing. Maybe it&#8217;s just me, but using these words sounds like it was written in the 19th century.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Mary and Joan entered the room, with the latter nervously clutching her handbag.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The following seems to flow so much better:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Mary and Joan entered the room<a href=\"https:\/\/wordcounter.net\/blog\/2016\/06\/24\/101812_capitalize-words-colon-semi-colon.html\">;<\/a> Joan was nervously clutching her handbag.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>But when your teacher makes a note saying you should discuss the latter point in greater detail, it&#8217;s helpful knowing which one he or she meant!<\/p>\n<h2>What Do You Think?<\/h2>\n<p>We know that the &#8220;former&#8221; is the person, thing or idea that came first, and we know that the &#8220;latter&#8221; is the last person, thing or idea to be mentioned, but do you think we ought to use these words? Do you use them? I&#8217;d be curious to know!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Here&#8217;s a nice easy one to remember the difference between the words former and latter.
