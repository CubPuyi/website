Learning these two words is a cinch.<\/p>\n<p>You might get away with not knowing the difference when speaking, as these two words are usually homophones (soundalikes). But your basic spell-checker won\u2019t always catch a usage error if you type a correctly spelled version of a word.<\/p>\n<p>In their most common usage, <em>affect<\/em> is a verb and<em> effect<\/em> is a noun. But each word can be either part of speech. Don\u2019t worry! We\u2019ll clear up the confusion for you.<\/p>\n<h2>Affect<\/h2>\n<p>So, is<em> affect<\/em> a verb or a noun? Well, it can be both.<\/p>\n<p>But the most common definition of <em>affect<\/em> is \u201cto alter\u201d or \u201cto act upon.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Look at this headline:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;New Study Examines How Tiny Gas Pockets Affect 3D Printing&#8221;<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cmu.edu\/news\/stories\/archives\/2019\/february\/3d-printing-gas-pockets.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Carnegie Mellon University<\/a><\/p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t already know the facts, there\u2019s no way to tell whether the gas pockets make good or bad changes\u2014or both.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some more examples:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Alcohol affects your ability to drive.<\/li>\n<li>Both humans and animals affect the climate.<\/li>\n<li>My brother\u2019s new romance is affecting his work.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Okay, so all three of these examples sound as if <em>affect<\/em> is only used in the sense of a negative change. That isn\u2019t always true. Check out these sentences:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Exercise affects your metabolism for hours afterward.<\/li>\n<li>Pets can affect your mood and physical health.<\/li>\n<li>My brother\u2019s new haircut is affecting his sales performance.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Did my brother\u2019s haircut turn him into a rock-star salesperson, or did it turn off his leads and prospects? There\u2019s no way to be sure, as <em>affect<\/em>\u00a0is a neutral verb.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, most people know that alcohol impairs your ability to drive. But if you want to be super-clear to your audience, you may want to choose a more specific verb than <em>affect<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Again, <em>affect<\/em> usually means \u201cto alter\u201d or \u201cto act upon.\u201d A great way to distinguish <em>affect<\/em> from effect is to remember that <em>affect<\/em>, <em>alter<\/em>, and <em>act<\/em> all start with \u201cA.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Other meanings of <em>affect<\/em> as a verb<\/h2>\n<p>You\u2019re going to run across other cases where <em>affect<\/em> is a verb, but with a different meaning. In fact, you\u2019ll see several dictionary definitions of <em>affect<\/em>. Here are a few:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>To feign<\/li>\n<li>To cultivate<\/li>\n<li>To tend toward<\/li>\n<li>To frequent<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Luckily, most of these definitions aren\u2019t all that common anymore. Just focus on the primary definition that we\u2019ve explained in detail above.<\/p>\n<h2>Affect as a noun<\/h2>\n<p>Wait, what? That\u2019s right: <em>Affect<\/em> can be a noun. But again, don\u2019t worry too much about this, as you\u2019re not likely to confuse this <em>affect<\/em> with an <em>effect<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>For one, <em>affect<\/em> as a noun is pronounced differently than the verb. The noun form has its stress on the first syllable and a short \u201cA\u201d sound.<\/p>\n<p>Also, this word is more commonly used in the realms of medicine and psychology. The meaning of <em>affect<\/em> here is \u201cthe signs of an emotional state.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For example, a psychiatric client may be described as having a flat affect. This means that, regardless of the client\u2019s inner experience or feelings, they appeared to the observer to have no emotion at all.<\/p>\n<p>So, if you see <em>affect<\/em> used this way, you\u2019ll surely be able to understand the difference.<\/p>\n<h2>Effect<\/h2>\n<p>Now, is <em>effect<\/em> a verb or a noun? Well, again, it\u2019s both. But we\u2019re going to clarify the word for you.<\/p>\n<p>Look at this headline:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Peppa Effect: Canadian Kids Are Talking With English Accents Thanks To &#8216;Peppa Pig'&#8221;<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.ca\/2019\/02\/14\/peppa-pig-accent-kids_a_23669624\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">HuffPost<\/a><\/p>\n<p>An effect is an end or event. Here are some more examples:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Alcohol has an effect on your ability to drive.<\/li>\n<li>Both humans and animals have an effect on the climate.<\/li>\n<li>My brother\u2019s new romance is having an effect on his work.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Do these sentences sound familiar? You got it: They\u2019re almost identical to three of the examples for <em>affect<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>This shows that affecting something yields an effect. This pair of words is simply two sides of the same coin.<\/p>\n<p>You may have noticed that using <em>effect<\/em> instead of <em>affect<\/em> lengthens these sentences unnecessarily. Choosing strong verbs is a sign of advanced writing, so using <em>affect<\/em> is theoretically the better choice. But these sentences are still correct.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some more efficient examples of using <em>effect<\/em>:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What are the side effects of this medicine?<\/li>\n<li>It\u2019s a matter of cause and effect.<\/li>\n<li>Perfumes have a bad effect on my allergies.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Again, <em>effect<\/em> usually means to an end or event. A great way to distinguish <em>effect<\/em> from <em>affect<\/em> is to remember that <em>effect<\/em>, <em>end<\/em>, and <em>event<\/em> all start with \u201cE.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Effect as a verb<\/h2>\n<p><em>Effect<\/em> has several other definitions as a noun, but these definitions aren\u2019t the ones that are commonly confused with <em>affect<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>The interesting thing, though, is that <em>effect<\/em> can also be a verb. This is probably the trickiest part of the whole matter.<\/p>\n<p>Because <em>effect<\/em> means \u201cto cause to exist.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s okay! This isn\u2019t exactly the same meaning as that of the verb <em>affect<\/em>. Remember, <em>affect<\/em> means &#8220;to alter&#8221; or &#8220;act upon.&#8221; In other words, &#8220;to change something,&#8221; not to cause or create it.<\/p>\n<p>Look at this headline:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Never Underestimate the Power of Young People to Effect Change&#8221;<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.ca\/elisa-birnbaum\/never-underestimate-the-power-of-young-people-to-effect-change_a_23375517\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">HuffPost<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Young people aren\u2019t changing change! They\u2019re bringing it about.<\/p>\n<p>Read these other examples, and you\u2019ll notice the difference immediately:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pollution effects climate change.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Pollution affects the climate, but it doesn\u2019t effect the climate itself. See?<\/p>\n<p>Now, look at this:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Boston Tea Party effected the American Revolution.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This means, as you probably know, that the Boston Tea Party came first. If the tea party had affected the revolution, the revolution would\u2019ve already been underway.<\/p>\n<h2>How to use <em>affect<\/em> and <em>effect<\/em> correctly<\/h2>\n<p>Usually:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;To affect&#8221; means to change, influence, modify, or transform something.<\/li>\n<li>An effect is a result, outcome, reaction, or product.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We know you\u2019ve got this. Go forth and use <em>affect<\/em> and <em>effect<\/em> confidently!<\/p>\n<p>For some more tricks on how to remember the difference, check out our blog post <a href=\"https:\/\/wordcounter.net\/blog\/2016\/10\/14\/102406_effect-vs-affect.html\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Don\u2019t let the difference between affect and effect affect your self-confidence.
