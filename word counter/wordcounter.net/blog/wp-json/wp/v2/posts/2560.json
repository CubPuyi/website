You will be liberated! I certainly was. At school, we were taught you should never, ever, under any circumstances start a sentence with a conjunction. That rules out starting sentences with either &#8220;and&#8221; or &#8220;but&#8221; when writing. I faithfully learned the rule. I became positively angry when I read books in which otherwise excellent writers seemed to make this faux pas. How could they be so sloppy?<\/p>\n<p>One day, I decided to settle the matter once and for all. I would find an authoritative reference to back up what I had learned, and I would send it to someone who had just argued you can start a sentence with &#8220;but.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2>Being Wrong Can Make You Happy<\/h2>\n<p>Once I started to check, I quickly realized I was going to be proved wrong. People, including some of the greatest writers of all time, have been starting sentences with &#8220;and&#8221; and &#8220;but&#8221; for hundreds of years. Of course, there are style guides that discourage it, but <strong>it&#8217;s perfectly acceptable to begin a sentence with &#8220;but&#8221;<\/strong> when writing. I was thrilled! That very day, I started peppering my writing with sentences starting with conjunctions. But one shouldn&#8217;t go overboard! See what I did there? Hah!<\/p>\n<p>Using any stylistic quirk too frequently spoils your writing. By all means, start sentences with &#8220;but&#8221; from time to time, but remember that &#8220;but&#8221; also belongs after a comma. I did it again, didn&#8217;t I?<\/p>\n<h2>When Should You Consider Starting a Sentence With &#8220;But&#8221;?<\/h2>\n<p>&#8220;Contrary to what your high school English teacher told you, there&#8217;s no reason not to begin a sentence with but or and; in fact, these words often make a sentence more forceful and graceful. They are almost always better than beginning with however or additionally.&#8221; (Professor Jack Lynch, Associate Professor of English, Rutgers University, New Jersey)<\/p>\n<p>Thank you, professor! I&#8217;ll admit to using &#8220;however,&#8221; but being lazy, I really do prefer the word &#8220;but&#8221; to begin a sentence when given a choice. &#8220;Additionally&#8221; is just awful, and I flinch every time I start a sentence with it. It seems so pompous!<\/p>\n<p>The professor also confirms starting with the conjunction can make your writing more forceful. Remember, you don&#8217;t always want to be forceful. Sometimes sentence flow is more appropriate. But a choppy &#8220;but&#8221; at the start of a sentence certainly does seem to add emphasis when that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re looking for.<\/p>\n<h2>People Are Going to Argue This With You<\/h2>\n<p>Just as I once was a firm believer in the &#8220;never start a sentence with and or but&#8221; non-rule, you&#8217;ll come across enslaved souls who have been taught the very same non-rule. Where can they turn for confirmation and comfort? <a href=\"https:\/\/wordcounter.net\/blog\/2015\/12\/08\/10975_how-many-words-bible.html\">The Bible<\/a> is always a good place. Refer them to Genesis Chapter 1 for sentences starting with &#8220;and.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>For a sentence starting with &#8220;but,&#8221; you may have to read <a href=\"https:\/\/wordcounter.net\/blog\/2016\/01\/18\/101070_further-away-versus-farther-away.html\">a little further<\/a> &#8211; all the way to Genesis 8:1: &#8220;But God remembered Noah and all the wild animals and the livestock that were with him in the ark, and he sent a wind over the earth, and the waters receded.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Looking around online, I see some arguing that using the Bible as a work of English literature is pushing the envelope. I beg to differ, but perhaps as the world&#8217;s greatest bestseller, it&#8217;s a bit too commercial for them. Let&#8217;s take them to the real authority: the notoriously stuffy and pedantic, <em>Fowler&#8217;s Modern English Usage<\/em>. It&#8217;s seen as the authoritative book on English Grammar, and if they won&#8217;t believe it, they&#8217;re never going to believe anyone.<\/p>\n<p>If they&#8217;re trying to find a comeback, you can always help them out. But they won&#8217;t be impressed with the reference you give them because I&#8217;m ready to bet you anything they&#8217;ve never have heard of Quackenbos!<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;A sentence should not commence with the conjunctions and, for, but, or however&#8230;. &#8221; (George Payn Quackenbos, An Advanced Course of Composition and Rhetoric, 1854)<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s sum up that argument, ladies and gentlemen of the jury. We have the Bible, a host of brilliant writers, and<em> Fowler&#8217;s Modern English Usage<\/em> vs&#8230; Quackenbos. I&#8217;ll see your Quackenbos and I&#8217;ll raise you an Albert Einstein. Oops, we&#8217;ve gone from law to poker. Please pardon the mixed metaphors. Of course, <a href=\"https:\/\/wordcounter.net\/blog\/2016\/10\/19\/102556_shakespeare-common-every-day-quotes.html\">Shakespeare<\/a> also occasionally mixed metaphors, but we&#8217;ll go into that another time, shall we?<\/p>\n<h2>Why Were Students Taught This Non-Rule Rule?<\/h2>\n<p>Why were we taught this non-rule rule about not starting sentences with conjunctions? Several authorities seem to think it was done to prevent school kids from writing as they often talk:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I went to my friend&#8217;s house yesterday. And we decided to go to the mall. And while we were there we saw a whole bunch of our friends. And they were just hanging out like we were. And because we didn&#8217;t have any money that was all we could do, really.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Or<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;But then John said he&#8217;d had a birthday, and we could all go for ice creams. But when we got to the ice-cream parlor, he found that he had left his wallet at home. But that didn&#8217;t stop us from having a good time together while teasing John that he owed us an ice-cream.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>You have to admit, that&#8217;s a bit much. So to close, we quote Oscar Wilde, &#8220;Everything in moderation, including moderation.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Today, I am here to set you free from one of the shibboleths of grammar.
