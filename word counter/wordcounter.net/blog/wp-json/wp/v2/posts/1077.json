One of the most common excuses is writer&#8217;s block (whether that really exists <a href=\"https:\/\/wordcounter.net\/blog\/2014\/03\/18\/1088_writers-block-is-a-myth.html\">or not<\/a>). There&#8217;re few things worse than wanting to write but nothing seems to come out. I&#8217;ve found over the years that one of the best ways for me to tackle writer&#8217;s block is to step away from whatever I happen to be working on at that moment, and just get myself writing again. For me, if I can begin to write anything, then the words begin to flow on the original project where the writer&#8217;s block started. <\/p>\n<p>One of the best ways to do this is through creative writing prompts. These appeal to me mainly because they are fresh ideas and I don&#8217;t have the inhibition of writing badly since I know I&#8217;m the only one who is going to be reading them. The problem is finding new writing ideas to prompt me into writing. With that in mind, and knowing others may also be in a similar situation as I, here are some creative writing ideas to help you beat that writer&#8217;s block.<\/p>\n<h2>50 Creative Writing Prompts<\/h2>\n<p>When it comes to these writing prompts, there are no rules to how you should write. Whether you decide to write a short story, a poem, an essay a haiku or any other form, the main objective is to simply begin writing. Choose ant of the prompts that speaks most to you and let the words begin to flow&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>1. Suddenly, I knew&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>2. &#8220;How long have I got?&#8221; she asked.<\/p>\n<p>3. He knew it couldn&#8217;t last forever.<\/p>\n<p>4. Suddenly, she began to laugh aloud.<\/p>\n<p>5. Everything had changed, and he knew that he&#8217;d have to change too.<\/p>\n<p>6. It had been a terrible year, but at the same time, she wouldn&#8217;t have changed a thing because&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>7. The old man had looked like an easy victim, but&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>8. It was the coldest winter on record, and all the roads were closed.<\/p>\n<p>9. As the storm became fiercer, there was a knock at the door.<\/p>\n<p>10. If my car hadn&#8217;t broken down that day, I&#8217;d never have&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>11. I broke every one of my New Year&#8217;s resolutions that day.<\/p>\n<p>12. It was the best summer ever.<\/p>\n<p>13. She could hear the crowd cheering her on.<\/p>\n<p>14. Would you believe that a butterfly could change your life?<\/p>\n<p>15. The traffic policeman scanned the horizon and saw an approaching dust cloud.<\/p>\n<p>16. If only Harry had remembered to close the window.<\/p>\n<p>17. It was the first time I&#8217;d ever tried to sail a boat.<\/p>\n<p>18. The world exploded into a rainbow of colors.<\/p>\n<p>19. Sometimes, the wrong thing turns out to be right after all.<\/p>\n<p>20. &#8220;You can&#8217;t do that!&#8221; he exclaimed.<\/p>\n<p>21. I never thought I&#8217;d be famous until&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>22. It was the most embarrassing moment of my life.<\/p>\n<p>23. Choose a photo and develop your story around the scene.<\/p>\n<p>24. Pick a family anecdote and turn it into an amusing story.<\/p>\n<p>25. Think of a famous person and write a journal entry as if you were that person.<\/p>\n<p>26. Begin with &#8220;I used to believe that&#8221; and simply write.<\/p>\n<p>27. I never liked a sore loser&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>28. The coals were still smoldering long after midnight.<\/p>\n<p>29. She never looked more beautiful than she did at that moment.<\/p>\n<p>30. He fiddled nervously with his phone and wondered about&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>31. Everyone was afraid of Mr. Wilkins.<\/p>\n<p>32. Describe a person&#8217;s appearance in a way that reveals something about their character.<\/p>\n<p>33. I have never met a cheekier child.<\/p>\n<p>34. Something strange happens every time I hear that song.<\/p>\n<p>35. I had never cooked a meal before&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>36. Today, I knew that I needed a complete change.<\/p>\n<p>37. Choose ten clich\u00e9s or idioms and find creative ways to say the same thing.<\/p>\n<p>38. We didn&#8217;t plan to get lost in the woods.<\/p>\n<p>39. The plane was rapidly losing height. He knew he had only one chance.<\/p>\n<p>40. If only I had remembered what my mother always said.<\/p>\n<p>41. It was the most inspiring thing she had ever seen.<\/p>\n<p>42. He never thought he&#8217;d end up being a hero.<\/p>\n<p>43. The silence was more powerful than any scream.<\/p>\n<p>44. Aliens? I never believed in them until&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>45. They always called him &#8216;the mad hermit&#8217;, but he was saner than any of us.<\/p>\n<p>46. Imagine being caught in an earthquake or a flood. What happens? What would you do?<\/p>\n<p>47. That day, he discovered that magic was real&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>48. A desperately poor man finds a priceless artifact. What happens to him as a result?<\/p>\n<p>49. The strangest dream I ever had.<\/p>\n<p>50. Write a witty essay about writers&#8217; block. <\/p>\n<p>Do you have a good creative writing idea or prompt that has helped you in the past? Or have any of the above prompts made you think of new ones that could benefit other writers?
