In law, it&#8217;s not so much a matter of <a href=\"https:\/\/wordcounter.net\/\">how much you write<\/a> as how you write it. But as the saying goes: &#8220;Practice makes perfect,&#8221; and with <a href=\"https:\/\/wordcounter.net\/blog\/2016\/03\/17\/101245_best-font-business-proposal.html\">business deals<\/a>, agreements and even people&#8217;s futures on the line, if you miss an important point or choose the wrong words, the ramifications can be huge.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the main point you need to understand about writing and law school. You probably won&#8217;t be writing anything extraordinarily lengthy while at law school, but writing it will take a long time. You might spend hours on a single paragraph, tweaking it to make it just right. For the layman, legal writing might just look like a lot of words strung together, but every one of them is there for a reason and getting them right is crucial.<\/p>\n<h2>Your law review papers will be the longest<\/h2>\n<p>Most law students agree that the volume of writing isn&#8217;t so much of an issue. Your longest pieces will be law review papers, and the footnotes alone can be extensive and time-consuming. But they warn course work grades are often based on essays or papers, and the marks you get on these will make or break your pursuit of a law degree.<\/p>\n<p>In the first year, chances are you&#8217;ll have to do a course covering legal research and writing. As you may have guessed, it will involve quite a lot of writing. But thereafter, the volume of written work decreases. The most important thing will be being able to write well and cram a lot of information into a few clear sentences.<\/p>\n<p>So if you&#8217;re worried about required writing, the volume isn&#8217;t all that huge, but if you want to do well, you will probably need to practice not only your writing but your reading.<\/p>\n<h2>Practice reading?<\/h2>\n<p>At law school, you need to learn how to write like a lawyer, and there&#8217;s no better way of doing that than to learn to read like a lawyer. That means being able to grasp the language that is used &#8211; and believe me &#8211; although it&#8217;s English, it&#8217;s not the kind of English you&#8217;d usually use when you hang out with your buddies.<\/p>\n<p>According to many law professors, reading like a lawyer is the biggest hurdle for most students. You may need hours to read a case that&#8217;s only a few pages when you first become a student. The good news is that the more you read, the better you get at understanding all the legal language, and the better equipped you&#8217;ll be when the time comes to do your own writing.<\/p>\n<h2>It&#8217;s a learned skill &#8211; and you will use it a lot<\/h2>\n<p>If reading the terms and conditions for the app you&#8217;re planning to download makes your eyes go blurry, and wading through contracts before you sign them gives you a headache, you&#8217;re not alone. Legal writing is a learned skill and uses its own special language and terminology. If you have a genuine eagerness to become a lawyer, you will need to master it. <\/p>\n<p>You shouldn&#8217;t be considering a legal career if you don&#8217;t like writing. Legal writing is a bit like &#8220;blood and guts&#8221; and becoming a doctor. You might not see them all the time as a student, but when you do, things aren&#8217;t going to work out for you if you&#8217;re squeamish. Lawyers deal with words. There&#8217;s no such thing as a lawyer who doesn&#8217;t write.<\/p>\n<h2>Do you want to be a lawyer but not sure you&#8217;ll cope?<\/h2>\n<p>For a start, be absolutely sure you know what being a lawyer is like. A lot of students don&#8217;t. It&#8217;s nothing like what you see on TV. The reality of working in the legal field isn&#8217;t featured in courtroom dramas. The truth (and nothing but the truth) is that many lawyers will seldom see the inside of a courtroom. If you do end up in court, most of it will be very un-dramatic and quite boring.<\/p>\n<p>Before you <a href=\"https:\/\/wordcounter.net\/blog\/2016\/05\/16\/101630_college-admissions-essay.html\">apply for law school<\/a> read up on what being a lawyer would entail and how your career would progress. If law still sounds like just the thing for you, you can get a head start on your fellow students by reading &#8220;Thinking Like a Lawyer: A New Introduction to Legal Reasoning&#8221; by Frederick Schauer. Hint: It will likely cover a lot of the work you&#8217;ll be given in your first year.<\/p>\n<p>If you can grasp that legal reasoning, you&#8217;ll likely be able to manage the writing as well. Writing starts with thinking, and once you think like a lawyer, you should have the skills to write like one and get through law school.<\/p>\n<p>(Photo courtesy of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/slasher-fun\/3863797668\/\">Mathieu Marquer<\/a>)<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Becoming a lawyer means you have to become good at a very specialized type of writing.
