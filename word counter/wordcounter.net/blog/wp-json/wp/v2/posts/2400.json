There are a lot of people who say an essay should be five paragraphs, but it&#8217;s an extremely limiting rule, and unless you&#8217;ve been instructed to write a five paragraph essay, there&#8217;s no reason to stick to it.<\/p>\n<p>As a rule, you&#8217;ll write your essay in three main parts. First, you&#8217;ll introduce your topic to your reader. Next, you will have body text in which you discuss the topic in more detail, and finally, you&#8217;ll have a conclusion that tells your reader what you were able to see after looking into the facts or thinking through the topic.<\/p>\n<p>In its simplest form, an essay can consist of three paragraphs with one paragraph being devoted to each section. Proponents of the five paragraph essay say that the body text should consist of three paragraphs, but in reality, it&#8217;s fine to write more or fewer paragraphs in this section.<\/p>\n<h2>Guessing How Many Paragraphs Before You Begin<\/h2>\n<p>This is a rule of thumb, which means it won&#8217;t always work quite that way, but it&#8217;s handy all the same. In academic work, your paragraphs are likely to be a bit longer than most of the ones you see in this blog post. On average, there are usually <a href=\"https:\/\/wordcounter.net\/blog\/2016\/01\/07\/10986_how-many-words-paragraph.html\">100 to 200 words in a paragraph<\/a>. So if you&#8217;d like a guesstimate, you can assume that a 1,000-word essay will have between five and ten paragraphs.<\/p>\n<h2>What Points Do You Have to Cover?<\/h2>\n<p>Another, less limiting and more accurate way to work out how many paragraphs you need to cover your topic is to look at the main points you have to cover in the body text. A paragraph contains all the ideas that support or explain a single concept.<\/p>\n<p>When you are planning your essay, you will think of or research the main elements that are needed in the body text. It would be safe to assume you need at least one paragraph for each of these. Of course, if there is a lot of information to cover in order to explore each area, you may need more.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you are writing an essay on childhood development and exposure to technology, you will want to look into the physical, psychological and cognitive developmental effects of tech on kids. When you research this topic, you will find that there are contrasting points of view and researchers have identified several physical, developmental, and psychological effects of technology use in children.<\/p>\n<p>Assuming five psychological effects have been identified, you can assume you&#8217;ll need to write five paragraphs if you are going to write a relatively in-depth essay. But if both those who say technology is bad for kids and those who say it can be good have done a great deal of work on the sub-topic, you might want to make that ten paragraphs so that you can cover both sides of the argument and look into how earlier authors reached their conclusions.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, if you have been set a relatively short <a href=\"https:\/\/wordcounter.net\/blog\/2016\/01\/26\/101025_how-to-reduce-essay-word-count.html\">word limit<\/a>, you may not be able to go in-depth at all, in which case a paragraph for each of the main sub-topics (psychology, physical development, and cognitive development) will likely be adequate.<\/p>\n<h2>Essay Content Is More Important Than the Number of Paragraphs<\/h2>\n<p>Ultimately, your essay will be evaluated on the information you present, not on the number of paragraphs in the essay. Early in your academic life, teachers and lecturers may give you both a structure for your essay and a guideline on how long each part of the essay should be. I have seen essay instructions say how many marks are allocated for each section, and my trick is to take the total <a href=\"https:\/\/wordcounter.net\">word count<\/a> and allocate a percentage of words to each section based on the percentage of marks you can get for it. After all, if the teacher is allocating 80 marks for content in total and you can see 50% of the mark relates to a certain part of the essay, then 50% of your essay&#8217;s words should be devoted to that section.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes, you&#8217;ll just be given a topic and told to air your opinion. This gives you more freedom, but it&#8217;s a tad more difficult. The research will show you how many angles you should look at, and it&#8217;ll help you to find information that both supports and contradicts your point of view. To make a strong argument, you need to look at both supporting and contradictory information.<\/p>\n<p>To avoid getting tangled up in one aspect of the discussion, you&#8217;ll have to decide how long it should be. If it&#8217;s the most important aspect informing your conclusion, you can spend a little more time (and words) on that particular point. It could run into several paragraphs rather than just one or two.<\/p>\n<h2>Always Remember the Purpose of Paragraphs<\/h2>\n<p>Paragraphs structure information into sub-topics, and they make your work easier to read and understand thanks to the structure they provide. With careful advance planning, you&#8217;ll be able to work out more or less how many paragraphs you need to complete your essay.<\/p>\n<h2>How many paragraphs is&#8230;<\/h2>\n<p><em>For those looking for a general rule-of-thumb, below are some estimates on the number of paragraphs there would be in an essay of different lengths based on an average length of 150 words per paragraph. Of course, the number of paragraphs for your essay will depend on many different factors. You can use the following information for a general reference, but don&#8217;t take these numbers as literal.<\/em>.<\/p>\n<h2>Basic Essay Word to Paragraphs Conversions<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>A 100 word essay is 3 paragraph.
