					<description><![CDATA[This is a great article explaining that so many need to read and understand before they start writing. Not a lot of people actually know about this when they first begin writing and get suckered into writing for too little money. Your time is worth more than these places will pay. Don&#039;t get abused by them!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordcounter.net/blog/2015/08/17/10190_why-you-should-avoid-writing-for-content-mills.html#comments/5690&quot;&gt;Marleen Olorres&lt;/a&gt;.

This article is so true and it is quite sad how little you get when you do all the work. You may think this is the only way to start, but it really isn&#039;t worth your time and effort. Although some people do it because it might be little extra income, any serious writer should figure out another method.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You are never doing yourself a favor if you write for a content mill. All you are doing is trading time for a little cash now, and you will never be able to make a writing career doing that. Don&#039;t short change yourself. Avoid them at all costs!!!]]></description>
