Maybe if teachers assigned a reasonable amount of homework instead of too much, we&#039;d have time to properly proofread our essays. It&#039;s always the student&#039;s fault is a line of BS. ]]></description>

This helps a lot. So many forget the importance of proofreading but it is necessary even though it can be time consuming. It helps a lot since we are all human an all make mistakes.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Proofreading is so important and I know that after writing a long piece the last thing I&#039;m in the mood for is to proof but the best is to take a break and then get right back to it. If you don&#039;t proofread, your scores will suffer. It&#039;s difficult to do at first, but once you get into the habit of doing it (and find all the silly mistakes you made) you&#039;ll wonder how you ever did OK without doing it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for the free proof reader as part of word counter. I thought I proofread pretty well, but I started using the reader a few months ago and I can see a big improvement in my writing. My teachers have even commented on it. It&#039;s much easier to catch mistakes when you hear what you wrote rather than reading it for the fifth time. For those of us who don&#039;t have someone to read our essays, this is a great solution!]]></description>

I hate proofreading! By the time I finish writing, I&#039;m sooo over the assignment I have no energy to read it again. The teachers should be happy that I managed to finish their stupid writing assignment.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve never understood why my students don&#039;t proofread their work. If I see a paper that hasn&#039;t been proofread, I know the student  wrote it at the last minute and didn&#039;t have the time or energy to proofread. This almost always results in points taken off the writing. After spending all that time writing the damn paper, it&#039;s just stupid not to proofread it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Isn&#039;t there some type of program that can proofread and correct writing? If there isn&#039;t, there should be. I want to put my writing into a website and it have it correct everything so it&#039;s perfect and I don&#039;t get a bad grade for it. What I want is a proofreading program so I don&#039;t have to proofread my papers myself.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As a student teacher, I wish more people would take the time to proofread. It&#039;s so frustrating seeing all the common mistakes that would have easily been caught if the student had just reread their work. It doesn&#039;t take much time, but it can be the difference in a whole grade on a paper.]]></description>
