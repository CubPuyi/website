					<description><![CDATA[This is a great little tool! Extremely helpful for scholarly writing. I would love to see a thesaurus function somewhere or the ability to highlight &quot;difficult words&quot; that factor into the reading level calculator. That way, we can focus on areas that would improve the reading level. Thank you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My only complaint is the &#039;details&#039; section needs to line up with the text box. When I&#039;m writing I like to see as much of the text as possible and I use a large box. Placing the top of the text box at the top edge of the browser window blocks the view of several pieces of information such as word count and characters.

Thanks for a great word counter.]]></description>
