This is a great challenge for up and coming writers. It will also help improve writing speed and creativity. 1000 words might sound like a lot, but it&#039;s actually a number that can be written quite quickly once you get the hang of it.]]></description>

When you start out 1000 words sound like an impossible number, but once you chose your topic and start writing it is so easy to complete this challenge. The hardest part of writing is beginning. Once you begin, it becomes a lot easier. Don&#039;t think about it and just do it. This is a great challenge and so much fun.]]></description>

It would be great if i could learn to consistently write 1000 words a day as this would help me write my novel in no time. Thank you for the inspiration.]]></description>
